" Target number 24, so we have two, two, seven, seven, and we need a multiple of 24, so it's gonna be two times two is four, seven times, I mean, seven plus seven is 14, so the highest if we add them all together is gonna be 18, which means the multiplication has to be done here so 7 times 2 is 14. um and so i have 14 7 and 2 if i uh multiply 7 times 2 that's 14 that's 28 too much. If I do 14 minus 7 plus 2, no. If I do 14 times 2, yes that would work but then I'd have an extra 7 left over. How could I solve that? 14 times 2 would be 28. I'd have an extra 7 left over. And that would not work. It would bring me back down to 21. Okay, let's do 7 plus 2, which is 9. Which means I have 9, 7, and 2. 9 times 7 is 30. Wait, 9 times 7 is 63. that's too freaking much girl uh seven times two is 14 maybe and then 14 plus nine um why am i being slow right now? 6, 7, 8, 9, 3, oh I think that's 23, that sucks. Yeah, that's 23. So one less, okay. Then I have 2, 2, 7, 7. So let's do 2 plus 2, which is 4. So I have 7, 7, 4 was 4 times 7, 28. 4 times 7 is 28. And I have an extra 7 left over. How can I fix this problem? I'm thinking maybe there's a way to square them. Or maybe I'm missing parentheses. I don't know. Parentheses can come last. 7 minus 7, that's 0. 7 minus 2 is 5. 10 times 2 is 10, plus 7 is 17. 7 times 2 is 14, plus 7 is 21, plus 2 is 23 now seven times two divided by wait seven times 2 14 divided by 7 no is equal to","```python
