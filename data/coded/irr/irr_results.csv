" All right, next one. It's big numbers again. This will be harder. Okay, so, let's see, 12 minus 7 is 5. That doesn't work there. Let's see. Nope. Any division is going to be wrong because it's got multiple. Let's see if I can do some multiplication here. Let's see what we come up with. 6 and then 2, 3, carry the 1, 6, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20. 5. Then, divide by that, which would be, nope, that doesn't work. Shoot. Let's try those two together. Let's see here. 1, 2, 1, carry the 4. Okay. Let's see there. Oh, 7 and 5. We come up with a decimal, so that doesn't work. And I take care of there. That comes up with 29. That's not right. I'm not going to be able to get this one. So, I'll sit here and continue to talk about the numbers to try to help you in your experiment, but this one's beyond me. I don't know how to do it. So, anything I've tried, I've tried multiplication. I've tried division. I've tried grouping them to do both things, and I come up with close answers. I've come up with 29. I've come up with 28. I came up with 26 one time, but I cannot hit the 24 number. So, like I say, I'm trying to continue to talk to you so that it matches up with what you want in your experiment. But I've tried the things that I can see to try on this one, and this one's too hard for me. So, I'll just continue to sit here with you until I time out. So, hopefully the three minutes runs out pretty quick because this is getting frustrating. All right. Still waiting for that three minutes to run out.

Any division is going to be wrong because it's got multiple. Let's see if I can do some multiplication here. Let's see what we come up with. 6 and then 2, 3, carry the 1, 6, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20. 5. Then, divide by that, which would be, nope, that doesn't work. Shoot. Let's try those two together. Let's see here. 1, 2, 1, carry the 4. Okay. Let's see there. Oh, 7 and 5. We come up with a decimal, so that doesn't work. And I take care of there. That comes up with 29. That's not right. I'm not going to be able to get this one. So, I'll sit here and continue to talk about the numbers to try to help you in your experiment, but this one's beyond me. I don't know how to do it. So, anything I've tried, I've tried multiplication. I've tried division. I've tried grouping them to do both things, and I come up with close answers. I've come up with 29. I've come up with 28. I came up with 26 one time, but I cannot hit the 24 number. So, like I say, I'm trying to continue to talk to you so that it matches up with what you want in your experiment. But I've tried the things that I can see to try on this one, and this one's too hard for me. So, I'll just continue to sit here with you until I time out. So, hopefully the three minutes runs out pretty quick because this is getting frustrating. All right. Still waiting for that three minutes to run out.

" All right, next one. It's big numbers again. This will be harder. Okay, so, let's see, 12 minus 7 is 5. That doesn't work there. Let's see. Nope. Any division is going to be wrong because it's got multiple. Let's see if I can do some multiplication here. Let's see what we come up with. 6 and then 2, 3, carry the 1, 6, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20. 5. Then, divide by that, which would be, nope, that doesn't work. Shoot. Let's try those two together. Let's see here. 1, 2, 1, carry the 4. Okay. Let's see there. Oh, 7 and 5. We come up with a decimal, so that doesn't work. And I take care of there. That comes up with 29. That's not right. I'm not going to be able to get this one. So, I'll sit here and continue to talk about the numbers to try to help you in your experiment, but this one's beyond me. I don't know how to do it. So, anything I've tried, I've tried multiplication. I've tried division. I've tried grouping them to do both things, and I come up with close answers. I've come up with 29. I've come up with 28. I came up with 26 one time, but I cannot hit the 24 number. So, like I say, I'm trying to continue to talk to you so that it matches up with what you want in your experiment. But I've tried the things that I can see to try on this one, and this one's too hard for me. So, I'll just continue to sit here with you until I time out.

No, that wouldn't work out. It needs to be divisible by... 4 and 8. So, um, let's see. 8 times 6 is 48, and that would leave me with 13 and 15, which I can't really do much with. So, um...

Okay, let's see. The start state is [1,4,7,12], and the response given is (1+7)+(12+4). The participant took 90 seconds, so they probably worked through some steps.

Looking at the transcript: They repeat the numbers a few times, maybe trying to focus. Then they say ""4 plus 7, 4, 12. It's pretty simple."" Wait, that might be a mistake. Then ""1 plus 7 is 8. Plus 16. Plus 16. Okay, yeah, 8 plus 6 is 24. 1 plus 7 plus Yeah, should be 24 all day long.""

Hmm, the participant seems to first compute 1+7=8. Then they mention adding 16, which might come from 12+4. So combining those two results: 8 + 16 = 24. But in their final response, they have (1+7)+(12+4), which is exactly 8+16=24. 

So the steps would be: first add 1 and 7 to get 8, then add 12 and 4 to get 16, then sum those two. The graph should show these steps. 

Wait, but in the transcript, they say ""Plus 16. Plus 16."" Maybe they thought of 12+4 as 16. Then adding that to 8. So the operations would be:

1. 1+7=8, resulting in state (4,8,12)
2. Then 12+4=16, so move to that state and then add those to get 24?

Wait, but the participant might have done both additions in parallel. Let me check the code structure. The explore_operation function can handle combining two numbers each time. So first, adding 1+7=8. Then, in the same state, adding 12+4=16. Then combining 8 and 16 to multiply? Wait, no, the response is adding both sums. But how does that work in steps?

Wait, the participant's response is (1+7)+(12+4). So they have two separate additions. But in the game, each operation combines two numbers. So the steps would be:

First, combine 1+7=8, resulting in [4,8,12]. Then combine 4+12=16, resulting in [8,16]. Then combine 8+16=24. But the participant's transcript mentions ""1 plus 7 is 8. Plus 16."" So maybe they thought of adding 12+4 to get 16 first, then add 8 and 16. But the code needs to represent each operation step.

Wait, the transcript says ""1 plus 7 is 8. Plus 16. Plus 16."" So maybe they first get 8, then add 12+4=16, then sum 8+16. So the steps would be:

1. 1+7 → 8, new state (4,8,12)
2. Then in the same state, 12+4 → 16, new state (8,16)
3. Then 8+16 →24.

But in the code, each explore_operation is a single operation. So first, the participant does 1+7=8. Then moves to that state, then does 12+4=16, then combines 8+16=24.

Wait, but the code's explore_operation can handle combining two numbers each time. Let me structure the code accordingly.

So first, start_state is (1,4,7,12). The first operation is 1+7=8, resulting in (4,8,12). Then move_to_node to that state. Then explore_operation to combine 4 and 12 into 16. Then move_to_node to (8,16), then combine them into 24.

But the participant's transcript might have combined steps. Let's check the transcript again. They say ""1 plus 7 is 8. Plus 16. Plus 16. Okay, yeah, 8 plus 6 is 24."" Wait, that ""8 plus 6"" might be a mistake. Wait, the transcript says ""8 plus 6 is 24""? That doesn't make sense. Wait, original transcript: ""Okay, yeah, 8 plus 6 is 24 1 plus 7 plus Yeah, should be 24 all day long"". That seems like a possible error. Maybe they meant 8 + 16? Because 12+4=16. So perhaps the participant made a verbal mistake, saying ""8 plus 6"" but actually meant ""8 plus 16"".

So the correct steps are 1+7=8, 12+4=16, then 8+16=24. So the code should reflect that.

So in the code:

First, explore_operation for 1+7=8, resulting in (4,8,12). Then move_to_node there. Then explore_operation for 4+12=16, resulting in (8,16). Then move_to_node and explore_operation 8+16=24.

But the participant's response is (1+7)+(12+4), which is exactly that. So the code should model these steps. Also, the transcript mentions ""plus 16"" twice, which aligns with adding 12 and 4.

So putting this into code:

start_state = (1,4,7,12)
curr_state = start_state
graph = GraphBuilder(curr_state)

# First operation: 1+7=8
new_state1 = graph.explore_operation(
    curr_state,
    operation=""1+7=8"",
    resulting_state=(4,8,12),
    comment=""Participant says '1 plus 7 is 8'"",
)

# Move to the new state (4,8,12)
curr_state = graph.move_to_node(new_state1)

# Next operation: 4+12=16
new_state2 = graph.explore_operation(
    curr_state,
    operation=""4+12=16"",
    resulting_state=(8,16),
    comment=""Participant mentions adding to get 16, likely 4+12=16"",
)

# Move to (8,16)
curr_state = graph.move_to_node(new_state2)

# Final operation: 8+16=24
new_state3 = graph.explore_operation(
    curr_state,
    operation=""8+16=24"",
    resulting_state=(24,),
    comment=""Combining 8 and 16 to reach 24"",
)

That should model the participant's steps correctly. Also, the participant's final response matches this path. The transcript's mention of ""plus 16"" twice might indicate they considered adding those numbers. The possible confusion with ""8 plus 6"" is likely a verbal error, so we proceed with the correct calculation.

Okay, let's see. The participant is working on the problem with numbers 1, 1, 5, 6. They need to make 24. The response they submitted is (5-1)x6x1. Let's break down their thought process.

First, they mention that adding all numbers straight across isn't enough. So they start trying different combinations. They tried 1+1=2, then thought about subtracting that from 5 to get 3, but 6x3=18, which isn't 24. Then they considered 6 divided by 2 (which would be 3) and multiplying by 5 to get 15, which also doesn't work. 

Next, they tried 5+1=6 and then 6x6=36, which is too high. They also tried 1+6=7 and multiplying by 5, which is too big. Then they thought of 5-1=4. Wait, here's the key part. They realized that 5-1=4, then multiply by 6 and 1. So 4x6x1=24. 

So the correct operations are (5-1) =4, then multiply by 6 to get 24, and then multiply by 1 (which doesn't change the result, but uses all numbers). The participant's final answer uses these steps. 

In the graph, I need to represent each step they took. The first steps are incorrect attempts, which should be included as explored operations. Then the final correct path is 5-1=4, then 4*6=24, and then 24*1=24. However, since each number must be used once, the final state should be (24,) after using all numbers. 

Wait, the participant's response is (5-1)x6x1. So the operations are (5-1) =4, then multiply by 6 and 1. But in the game, each number must be used exactly once. So in the initial state [1,1,5,6], using 5, one of the 1s, and then 6 and the other 1. So the steps would be:

1. 5 - 1 =4 (using one 1)
2. Then multiply 4 by 6 to get 24 (using 6)
3. Then multiply 24 by the remaining 1 (which doesn't change the value but uses the last number).

But in the game, each operation combines two numbers into one, reducing the count each time. So the first operation (5-1) reduces the state from (1,1,5,6) to (1,4,6). Then multiplying 4 and 6 gives (1,24), and then multiplying 24 by 1 gives (24). 

So the code should have three steps: subtract 1 from 5, multiply the result by 6, then multiply by 1. Each of these steps needs to be captured in the graph with explore_operation calls. Also, the participant's transcript mentions trying other paths, which should be included as explored operations even if they didn't work.

I need to make sure that each operation in the code correctly reflects the numbers used and the resulting state. Also, the final correct path should be represented with the correct operations leading to (24,).

Okay, let's see. The participant is trying to solve the 24 game with the numbers 3, 3, 11, 12. Their response was 12+11+(3/3), which equals 24. The transcript shows their thought process.

First, they mention 12 + 11 = 23, but that leaves the two 3s. Then they try various combinations like 3*12=36 minus 11, which doesn't work. They also try 3*3=9 +12=21, but then there's still 11. Then they think of 12 divided by 3=4, times 3=12, plus 11=23. Finally, they realize adding 3/3 (which is 1) to 23 gives 24. 

So the steps are: combining 12 and 11 first, then using the two 3s as division to get 1. The code needs to represent each operation they tried. 

First, the initial state is (3,3,11,12). They try 12+11=23, resulting in (3,3,23). Then they might try 3/3=1, leading to (1,12,11). Then adding those to 23? Wait, but the correct path is combining 12+11 first, then adding 3/3. 

Wait, the correct solution is 12+11+(3/3) = 24. So the operations are: first, 3 divided by 3 equals 1. Then, 12 plus 11 equals 23. Then, 23 plus 1 equals 24. But how do they combine these steps? 

The participant's transcript mentions that after trying different combinations, they finally do 12 +11 equals 23, plus 3 divided by 3 equals 1, totaling 24. So the steps are: 

1. 3 / 3 = 1. This would take the two 3s and produce 1, leaving 1, 11, 12. 
2. Then, 12 + 11 = 23. Now, combining with the 1 gives 23 +1 =24. 

But in the code, each operation reduces the numbers. So first, the division of 3/3 would create a new state (1, 11, 12). Then, adding 12 and 11 to get 23, leading to (1,23). Then adding those to get 24. 

Alternatively, maybe the participant combined the operations in a different order. Let's map each step as per their transcript.

The code should use explore_operation for each step they mention. The first attempts are incorrect, like 12+11=23 (but that's part of the process). Then they try 3/3=1, and then add that to 23. 

So the steps in code:

- Start state (3,3,11,12)
- Try 12 + 11 =23 → resulting in (3,3,23)
- Then try 3/3=1 → resulting in (1,23)
- Then try 23 +1 =24 → resulting in (24,)

But the participant's correct solution is combining 12+11 and 3/3. So the code should reflect these steps. Also, the participant might have backtracked after trying other operations. 

Wait, in the transcript, the participant mentions trying different operations and failing, then finally arrives at the correct one. So in the code, we need to represent all the operations they tried, including the correct path. 

The correct path would be:

1. Start with (3,3,11,12)
2. Perform 3/3=1 → new state (1,11,12)
3. Then perform 11+12=23 → new state (1,23)
4. Then perform 23+1=24 → (24,)

But in the code, each operation is a single step. So each step must be an individual operation. The participant's final solution combines all steps into one expression, but in the transcript, they mention each part. 

The code should capture the correct steps. So first, the division of 3/3, then adding 11+12, then adding 23+1. However, in the game, each operation combines two numbers. So step 2 (11+12) would be an operation from the state (1,11,12), leading to (1,23). Then step 3 would be combining 1 and 23 to add. 

So the code would have:

- explore_operation for 3/3=1, resulting in (1,11,12)
- move_to_node to that state
- explore_operation for 11+12=23, resulting in (1,23)
- move_to_node to that state
- explore_operation for 1+23=24, resulting in (24,)

But the participant's response is written as 12+11+(3/3), which is equivalent. So the order might not matter as long as the operations are valid. 

Also, the transcript mentions that after trying other things, they realize that 12+11 plus 1 (from 3/3) works. So the code should include the correct operations, even if they are done in a different order. 

So the code steps would be:

1. Start state (3,3,11,12)
2. Perform 3/3=1 → (1,11,12)
3. Then, 11+12=23 → (1,23)
4. Then, 1+23=24 → (24,)

Each of these steps is an explore_operation. The code should reflect this. Also, the participant might have backtracked between these steps, but according to the transcript, they mention the final steps in sequence. 

So the code would be:

start_state = (3,3,11,12)
curr_state = start_state
graph = GraphBuilder(curr_state)

# First operation: 3 divided by 3
new_state1 = graph.explore_operation(
    curr_state,
    operation=""3/3=1"",
    resulting_state=(1,11,12),
    comment=""Participant divides 3 by 3 to get 1""
)

# Move to the new state (1,11,12)
curr_state = graph.move_to_node(new_state1)

# Next operation: 11 + 12 =23
new_state2 = graph.explore_operation(
    curr_state,
    operation=""11+12=23"",
    resulting_state=(1,23),
    comment=""Adding 11 and 12 to get 23""

    curr_state,
    operation=""1+23=24"",
    resulting_state=(24,),
    comment=""Adding 1 and 23 to reach 24""
)

This should correctly model the participant's solution path.

Okay, let's tackle this problem. The start state is [4,7,8,13], and the response given is 13+8+(7-4). The transcript shows the participant trying various combinations.

First, they mention 11, 19, 32. Not sure where those numbers come from. Maybe they were adding some numbers? Like 4+7=11, 8+11=19, but that's not in the start state. Wait, the start state has 4,7,8,13. Maybe they tried adding 4+7=11, then 11+8=19, then 19+13=32. But that's just a guess. Then they say 11 plus 13 is 24. Oh, that's interesting because 11+13=24, but 11 isn't in the original numbers. So they must have created 11 by combining 4 and 7. So first operation could be 4+7=11, leading to state (8,11,13). Then adding 11+13=24, but that would use up 11 and 13, leaving 8. Wait, but the resulting state would be (8,24), which isn't the goal. But the participant realizes that's not right.

Next, they mention 7 times 8 is 56. So they tried multiplying 7*8=56, leading to state (4,13,56). Then they correct themselves, maybe realizing that's too high. They mention 52, which is 13*4=52. So another operation: 13*4=52, resulting in (7,8,52). Then subtract 15 or 15. Not sure. Then they say ""13 plus 8. Plus 7 minus 4."" That seems like the correct path. Let's break that down.

The correct solution is 13+8+(7-4). Let's see how the participant got there. They might have first done 7-4=3. So operation 7-4=3, resulting in state (3,8,13). Then adding 13+8=21, then 21+3=24. Alternatively, combining all steps into one. But in the transcript, the final statement is ""13 plus 8. Plus 7 minus 4."" So they might have grouped them as (13+8) + (7-4) =21 +3=24.

So the graph steps would be:

1. Start at (4,7,8,13).
2. Try 7-4=3. Resulting state (3,8,13).
3. Then add 13+8=21. Resulting state (3,21).
4. Then add 21+3=24. Resulting state (24,).

But according to the code structure, each operation combines two numbers. So each step should be a binary operation. So the correct steps would be:

First, 7-4=3, leading to (3,8,13). Then 13+8=21, leading to (3,21). Then 21+3=24.

Alternatively, the participant might have done 13+8=21 first, then 7-4=3, then 21+3=24. The order might matter based on the transcript.

Looking at the transcript, the last line is ""13 plus 8. Plus 7 minus 4."" So they might have first added 13+8=21, then added 7-4=3, then added 21+3=24.

So the code would first explore 13+8=21, resulting in (7,21,4). Wait, original state is (4,7,8,13). If we take 13 and 8, combine them to 21, the new state would be (4,7,21). Then do 7-4=3, leading to (3,21). Then add 21+3=24.

But the code needs to represent each operation step. Let's structure it accordingly.

First operation: 13+8=21. Resulting state (4,7,21). Then 7-4=3. Resulting state (3,21). Then 21+3=24.

So in the code:

start_state = (4,7,8,13)
curr_state = start_state

First explore_operation for 13+8=21:
graph.explore_operation(curr_state, operation=""13+8=21"", resulting_state=(4,7,21), ...)

Then move_to_node (4,7,21), then explore_operation for 7-4=3:
graph.explore_operation(curr_state, operation=""7-4=3"", resulting_state=(3,21), ...)

Then move_to_node (3,21), then explore_operation for 21+3=24:
graph.explore_operation(curr_state, operation=""21+3=24"", resulting_state=(24,), ...)

But the transcript mentions trying other things before arriving at this solution. The participant first tried other combinations like 7*8=56, 13*4=52, etc. So those should be included in the graph as well.

So the steps in the code should be:

1. Start state.
2. Try 4+7=11 (from the first part of the transcript: ""11, 19, 32. So, 11 plus 13 is 24. Nope."") leading to (8,11,13). Then try 11+13=24, which would leave 8, but that's not the correct solution.
3. Then try 7*8=56, resulting in (4,13,56).
4. Then try 13*4=52, resulting in (7,8,52).
5. Then finally arrive at the correct path: 13+8=21, 7-4=3, then 21+3=24.

So the code needs to include all these attempts, even though they didn't lead to the solution. The transcript shows the participant trying multiple approaches before settling on the correct one.

Putting it all together, the Python code would first explore the incorrect paths before the correct one. Each operation is added as a node and edge in the graph, even if they are incorrect. The final correct steps are the last operations.

Okay, let's tackle this problem. The start state is [9,11,12,13], and the participant didn't submit a response, so they probably couldn't find a solution in 180 seconds. The transcript shows a lot of attempts and backtracking.

First, the participant starts by listing the numbers and mentions 24. They try various combinations. Let's parse each part step by step.

""13 minus 1, 11. 2. 2, 12 minus 3. No."" Hmm, maybe they meant 13-11=2, then 12-3=9? Not sure. But the transcript might have errors here.

Next, ""13 minus 9 is 4. No."" So 13-9=4. Then they use 12 and 11, maybe trying 12- something. They try ""12 minus 9, 3. Times 11, 33. Minus 13 is only 20."" So 12-9=3, then 3*11=33, 33-13=20. That's a valid path but not 24.

Then ""11 minus 9 is 2. Times 13, 26. Minus 12. No."" So 11-9=2, 2*13=26, 26-12=14. Wait, the participant says ""No"" so maybe they thought it was 14, but the transcript says 26-12 is 14, not 24. So that's a dead end.

""11 plus 13 12 plus 9 okay 21 no 21 see 12 plus 9 is 21..."" They check sums: 11+13=24? Wait, 11+13 is 24! Wait, but the start state has 9,11,12,13. If they add 11+13=24, but they still have 9 and 12 left. Oh, but the problem requires using all four numbers. So just adding two of them to get 24 isn't allowed. The participant might have realized that and then tried other combinations.

They mention ""9 plus 13 minus 1 plus 1..."" which seems like they're trying to adjust numbers but not getting anywhere. 

So in the code, each operation they tried should be represented. For example, 13-9=4, then maybe combining with other numbers. Then 12-9=3, 3*11=33, 33-13=20. Then 11-9=2, 2*13=26, 26-12=14. Also, trying sums like 11+13=24 but that leaves 9 and 12 unused, so invalid.

The participant might have set a subgoal of reaching 24 through combinations but kept hitting dead ends. Each of these steps needs to be translated into explore_operation calls, moving between states as they try different operations.

Also, note that some operations might have calculation errors. For example, if they said 3*11=33, that's correct, but then 33-13=20 is correct too. But maybe they thought it was 20 and dismissed it.

So the code should create nodes for each resulting state and edges for each operation. The participant backtracks a lot, so move_to_node might be used to return to previous states after failed attempts.

I need to make sure each operation in the transcript is captured, even if it's incorrect. Also, handle cases where the participant mentions operations that aren't explicit, inferring the steps from their words.

Okay, let's tackle this problem. The start state is [1,6,12,13], and the participant didn't submit a response, so they probably couldn't find a solution in 180 seconds. The transcript shows they tried several operations but didn't reach 24.

First, the participant starts by adding 13 and 12 to get 25. That's a common approach, trying to combine the larger numbers. But 25 is too high. Then they mention 6 times 12, which is 72, way over. They also tried 12 times 1, which is 12, not helpful. 

Next, they tried 12 plus 13 again, then added 6 to get 25+6=31, which isn't useful. Then they tried 6*13=78, then divided by 12 to get 6.5. That's a possible path but not leading to 24. 

I need to map each of these steps into the graph using the GraphBuilder methods. Each operation the participant mentions should be an edge in the graph. For example, ""13 plus 12 is 25"" would be an explore_operation from the start state to (1,6,25). Then moving on to other operations. 

Wait, the participant also mentioned ""6 times 12"" which is 72, so that's another explore_operation from start_state to (1,72). Then they tried 12*1=12, leading to (6,12,13). 

They also tried adding 6 to 25, which would be from (1,6,25) to (6,25), but that's not correct. Wait, no, the operation ""25 plus 6"" would be adding 6 to 25, resulting in 31, but since 25 is already a combined number, the resulting state would be (1,31)? Or wait, the original numbers after combining 13+12=25 leave 1 and 6. So adding 6 to 25 would be 25+6=31, but that uses the 6, leaving 1. So the state would be (1,31). But the participant might have made a mistake here.

Also, when they tried 6*13=78, that would use 6 and 13, leaving 1 and 12. So the resulting state would be (1,12,78). Then dividing 78 by 12 gives 6.5, which is another state.

I need to make sure each operation correctly replaces the numbers used. Each operation must use numbers present in the current state. For example, in the start state, to do 13+12, those numbers are present, so the resulting state would have 25, 1, and 6. Then any subsequent operations would use those numbers.

Also, when the participant backtracks, like moving back to the start state after trying something else, we need to use move_to_node to return to the previous state.

So the steps would be:

1. Start at (1,6,12,13)
2. Try 13+12=25 → new state (1,6,25)
3. Then try 25+6=31 → (1,31)
4. But participant says that's not working, so move back to start
5. Try 6*12=72 → (1,72)
6. Then try 12*1=12 → (6,12,13)
7. Then try 6*13=78 → (1,12,78)
8. Then 78/12=6.5 → (1,6.5)
9. Also tried 12+13+6=31 → but that's same as earlier steps

Each of these steps needs to be represented with explore_operation and move_to_node where necessary. Also, note any calculation errors, like if an operation is incorrect, set result_calc_error=True.

I should also check if any of these operations actually lead to 24, but according to the response being blank, they didn't find a solution. So the graph should show all the paths they tried without reaching (24,).

Now, translating this into code with the GraphBuilder methods, making sure each operation is correctly applied to the current state, adding nodes and edges as per the participant's transcript.

That makes sense because using 11-3=8 and then 8*3=24 uses three numbers (11,3,3) but leaves the 12 unused. Since all numbers must be used, this approach doesn't work. So I need to note that operation but also show they couldn't proceed further.

Next, they tried ""3 minus 12 minus 3 would be 9, minus 3 would be 6"". Wait, that seems a bit confusing. Let me parse that. Maybe they meant (12-3-3)=6, but then how does that help? They might have made a mistake here. Also, ""12 minus 11 is 1"" gives them a 1, but combining with other numbers like 3*3=9 plus 1 gives 10, which isn't helpful. 

They also tried ""12 divided by 3 is 4"" and ""11 minus 3 is 8"", then multiplying 4*8=32. But again, that uses three numbers and leaves one out. The participant is clearly struggling to find a way to use all four numbers. 

Another part says ""3 minus 3 is 4"" which is impossible, so that's a calculation error. They might have meant something else here, but it's unclear. 

So, in the code, I need to represent each of these attempts as operations in the graph. Each time they try an operation, even if incorrect, I should use explore_operation with result_calc_error set if necessary. Also, when they backtrack, use move_to_node to return to previous states. 

For example, when they first try 11-3=8 and then 8*3=24, that's two operations. But since they can't use the 12, maybe they move back and try other combinations. Each of these steps should be nodes in the graph with edges representing the operations. 

I also need to check if any of their attempts could lead to a valid solution. The actual solution for this set might be something like (12/(11-3)) * 3 = 24, but that uses only three numbers. Wait, no, all four must be used. Hmm. Maybe (12 - (11 - (3/3))) = 12 - (11 -1) = 12-10=2, which isn't helpful. Alternatively, ((12 - 11) + (3/3)) = 1+1=2, nope. 

Wait, perhaps there's no valid solution here, which is why the participant couldn't find one. The problem might be unsolvable. But the code should still represent their attempts accurately. 

So, in the code, each operation they mention should be added as an explore_operation, even if it's incorrect. For example, ""11 minus 3"" would be 8, then trying to multiply by 3, but leaving 12 unused. Each of these steps should be nodes. Also, when they try different operations from the start state, those should be separate edges. 

I need to make sure that each operation correctly uses the numbers from the current state. For example, when they do 11-3, they need to have those two numbers in the current state. If they try to use a number that's already been used in a previous operation, that might be an error, but the participant might still attempt it, so the code should reflect that. 

Also, when they mention ""3 minus 3 is 4"", that's a clear error, so the result_calc_error should be True. 

Putting it all together, the code should create a graph where each node is a state, and edges represent the operations they tried, including incorrect ones. The participant's backtracking (like moving back to the start state) should be handled with move_to_node. 

I'll start by initializing the graph with the start state. Then, for each operation mentioned in the transcript, add the corresponding explore_operation calls, using move_to_node when they switch focus back to a previous state. Each comment should reference the transcript line. 

I should also check for any possible subgoals they might have set. For example, when they mention ""target number is 24"", maybe they set a subgoal of reaching 24, but the transcript doesn't explicitly state that. The set_subgoal method is used when they mention working towards a specific state, but in this case, it's not clear, so maybe not necessary. 

Finally, since the participant didn't find a solution, the graph will end without reaching the (24,) node, or maybe they tried but with incorrect operations. The code should reflect their failed attempts.

Okay, let's tackle this problem. The start state is [4,4,7,7], and the participant's response was ""(4x4"", which seems incomplete. The response time was 180 seconds, so they didn't finish. The transcript shows a lot of attempts but no correct solution.

First, I need to parse the transcript and map each step to the graph. The participant tried several operations but kept getting stuck. Let's go through each part step by step.

They start by saying ""We got 8 and 14. That's only 22."" So maybe they tried adding 4+4=8 and 7+7=14, then 8+14=22. That's an initial attempt. So I should use explore_operation for each of those steps.

Next, ""7 times 4 is 28. 49 and 16. Dang."" They might have multiplied 7*4=28, then maybe 7*7=49 and 4*4=16. These are separate operations, so each should be an explore_operation.

Then, ""7 plus 4. 4 is 11. And 11 is 22."" This seems like adding 7+4=11, then adding another 11? Maybe they tried 7+4=11, then 11+11=22, but where does the second 11 come from? Maybe a miscalculation. Need to handle each step.

""7 minus 4 is 3. 3 times 4 is 12. 12 is 7."" Here, they subtract 7-4=3, then multiply by 4 to get 12, but then mention 12 is 7, which might be a mistake. Each operation should be separate.

""7 plus 7 is 14 minus... 7 times 4 is 28 minus 7 is 20."" They tried adding 7+7=14, then maybe 28-7=21, but they say 20. That's a calculation error. Need to note that.

""7 times 4 is 28 minus 7 is 21 plus 4 is 25."" Here, they correct the previous step, getting 21+4=25. Each of these steps should be separate operations.

""7 minus 7 is 0. 4 minus 4 is 0."" Subtracting pairs to get zeros, which isn't helpful. These are valid operations but lead to dead ends.

""4 plus... No. 4 times 4 is 16."" Trying addition first, then multiplying 4*4=16. Then they mention 7+4=11 again, leading to 16. But that's not helpful.

""What about 49 minus 24? What about 49 minus 28?"" They reference squares (7^2=49, 4^2=16) but subtract other numbers. These might be attempts to use different operations.

The participant seems to be going in circles, trying various combinations but not finding the correct path. The correct solution for [4,4,7,7] is usually (7 - 4/7)*4 = 24, but the participant didn't reach that.

Each of their statements should be translated into explore_operation calls, even if they result in errors. Also, when they backtrack, use move_to_node to return to previous states.

Need to make sure all operations are valid with the current state's numbers. For example, if they use 7*4, both 7 and 4 must be present in the current state.

Also, the response was ""(4x4"", which is incomplete, so they might have intended to do 4*4 but didn't finish. That might be an edge leading to (16,7,7), but since the response was blank, it's unclear.

I'll structure the code by creating each operation step by step, handling errors where they miscalculated, and moving back to previous states when they backtrack. Each comment in the code should reflect the transcript part.

Okay, let's see. The start state is [2,2,5,12], and the response is 5x2+2+12. The transcript says the participant figured it out quickly, mentioning 5 times 2 plus 2 plus 12. 

First, I need to model the steps the participant took. The participant probably started by identifying that 5*2 is 10. Then adding another 2 gives 12, and adding 12 to that gives 24. But wait, the order of operations here is important. The response is written as 5x2+2+12, which would be (5*2) + 2 + 12 = 10 + 2 +12 =24. 

So the steps would be:

1. Multiply 5 and 2 to get 10. The resulting state would be [2,10,12].
2. Then add 10 and 2 to get 12, resulting in [12,12].
3. Finally, add those two 12s to get 24.

But wait, the participant said ""5 times 2 plus 2 plus 12"" all in one go. However, according to the code structure, each operation combines two numbers. So each step should be a binary operation. 

So first, 5*2=10. Then, 10+2=12. Then 12+12=24. Each of these steps would be separate operations in the graph. 

But the participant might have thought of it as a single expression, but the code requires breaking it down into individual operations. However, the response given is a single expression, so maybe the participant did it all in one step. But according to the problem's guidelines, each operation replaces two numbers with the result. So each binary operation is a step.

Wait, the code's explore_operation function allows for multi-step operations if the operation string includes multiple steps. For example, if the operation is ""5*2+2+12=24"", the code might split it into sub-operations. But looking at the code, the get_sub_operations function (which isn't shown here) probably parses the operation string into individual steps. 

Alternatively, the code might handle each binary operation as a separate step. Since the participant's response is a single equation, but the actual process involves three steps (multiply 5 and 2, add 2, add 12), each step should be represented as a separate edge in the graph.

But the transcript says ""5 times 2 plus 2 plus 12"" as a single statement, which might be considered as a single operation leading directly to 24. However, according to the code's example, if the participant states an operation that combines multiple steps, like ""12*2=24"" when there are two numbers, it's allowed. But in this case, the operation uses three numbers (5,2,2,12) in the expression, which isn't allowed unless each step is broken down.

Wait, the operation must use numbers present in the current state. So the initial state is (2,2,5,12). The first step would be to take 5 and 2, multiply them to get 10, resulting in state (2,10,12). Then, take 10 and 2 to add, resulting in 12, and state (12,12). Then add those two 12s. 

Each of these steps would be separate calls to explore_operation. However, the participant might have said it all in one step, but the code should model each binary operation. 

But the transcript says ""I know this one. 5 times 2 plus 2 plus 12."" So the participant might have thought of it as a single operation, but according to the rules, each operation must combine two numbers. Therefore, the code should break it into three steps. 

So the Python code would first do 5*2=10, then 10+2=12, then 12+12=24. Each of these steps would be added via explore_operation. 

But how to represent this in the code? Let's outline:

start_state = (2,2,5,12)
curr_state = start_state

First operation: 5*2=10. Resulting state (2,10,12)
Then move to that state, then add 10+2=12. Resulting state (12,12)
Then move to that state and add 12+12=24.

Each of these steps would be separate explore_operation calls.

But the participant's response time is 20 seconds, which is quick, implying they did it in one step. However, the code must model each binary operation step. 

So the code should have:

1. explore_operation for 5*2=10
2. move_to_node to (2,10,12)
3. explore_operation for 10+2=12
4. move_to_node to (12,12)
5. explore_operation for 12+12=24

But the transcript might not mention each step explicitly. However, the participant's statement ""5 times 2 plus 2 plus 12"" suggests that they combined them in sequence. So the code should model each step.

Therefore, the code would be:

start_state = (2, 2, 5, 12)
curr_state = start_state
graph = GraphBuilder(curr_state)

# First, multiply 5 and 2
new_state1 = graph.explore_operation(
    curr_state,
    operation=""5*2=10"",
    resulting_state=(2, 10, 12),
    comment='""5 times 2""',
)

# Move to the new state (2,10,12)
curr_state = graph.move_to_node(new_state1)

# Then add 10 and 2
new_state2 = graph.explore_operation(
    curr_state,
    operation=""10+2=12"",
    resulting_state=(12, 12),
    comment='""plus 2""',
)

# Move to the new state (12,12)
curr_state = graph.move_to_node(new_state2)

# Then add 12 and 12
new_state3 = graph.explore_operation(
    curr_state,
    operation=""12+12=24"",
    resulting_state=(24,),
    comment='""plus 12""',
)

But the participant's response is ""5x2+2+12"", which combines all steps. However, according to the code's requirements, each binary operation must be a separate step. The code example in the first user message shows that even if the participant combines steps, each operation must be broken down. For example, in the first example, the participant said ""nine minus nine, minus nine minus three is six"" which was parsed as 9-3=6. So the code corrects transcription errors but follows the actual steps taken.

In this case, the participant's thought process is a single expression, but the actual steps require three operations. Therefore, the code should model each step. However, the transcript only mentions the entire expression once. But according to the problem's instructions, the code should model the operations as per the participant's verbalized steps, even if they mention it all at once.

Wait, but the transcript says: ""5 times 2 plus 2 plus 12."" So the participant might have done all that in one step. But according to the rules, each operation must combine two numbers. Therefore, the code must break it into three steps. 

So the code should have three explore_operation calls as outlined. The comments can reference the transcript's statement, but each step is a separate operation.

Okay, let's tackle this problem. The start state is [7,8,8,11], and the participant's response was ""8+7"", which equals 15. But they didn't submit a correct solution since the response time was 180 seconds, meaning they ran out of time. The transcript shows they tried various operations but couldn't find the right path.

First, I need to parse the transcript and map each step to the graph. Let's go through the transcript line by line.

The participant starts by saying the elevens are a problem. Then they try 7*8=56, but that's not helpful. They mention 8*8=16, which is a mistake (should be 64), so that's a calculation error. Then they try 16*7 divided by 11, which doesn't work. 

Next, they try to use 8 to eliminate itself, maybe by subtracting? But they can't because there's no 1. Then they think of 88 divided by 15 (from 7+8), which is not correct. 

They then try 7+11=18 and 18*8=144, then 144/8=18 again, which isn't helpful. They correct their earlier mistake about 8*8 being 64 instead of 16. Then they try 64*11=704 divided by 7, which is way off. 

Finally, they try 8+7=15, then subtract 8 to get 8, add 8 again to get 23, which doesn't help. 

So, each of these operations needs to be represented in the graph. For each operation, I need to use explore_operation, noting any calculation errors. Also, when they backtrack, use move_to_node to return to previous states.

Starting with the initial state (7,8,8,11), the first operation is 7*8=56, resulting in (8,11,56). Then they try 8*8=16 (error), resulting in (7,11,16). Then 16*7/11 (which is 112/11≈10.18), but since they mention divided by 11, resulting state (10.18, 8) maybe? But since the participant didn't get a correct step, perhaps mark as error.

They then try 7+11=18, leading to (8,8,18). Then 18*8=144, resulting in (7,144). Then 144/8=18, which loops back. 

They correct the 8*8 to 64, so that's a new operation. Then 64*11=704, divided by 7≈100.57, but that's not useful. 

Finally, they try 8+7=15, resulting in (8,11,15), then subtract 8 to get 8, but that's not helpful. 

Each of these steps should be added as nodes and edges in the graph, with comments explaining the transcript parts. Also, when they backtrack, move_to_node is used to return to previous states. Since the participant didn't find a solution, the graph should end without reaching (24).

Okay, let's see. The user provided a start state of [7,10,11,13], and the response is (13-11)x7+10. The transcript says: ""Target number 24 is easy. 13 minus 11 is 2 times the quantity times 7 is 14 plus 10 is 24."" 

First, I need to break down the participant's thought process into steps that can be represented in the graph. The participant starts by subtracting 11 from 13, which gives 2. Then they multiply that result by 7 to get 14. Finally, they add 10 to reach 24.

So, the first operation is 13-11=2. That would create a new state with 2, 7, 10. Then, multiplying 2 by 7 gives 14, leading to a state with 10 and 14. Adding those together gives 24. 

Wait, but according to the response, it's (13-11)*7 +10. So the operations are: subtract 11 from 13, multiply by 7, then add 10. Each step needs to be an operation in the graph.

I should check if each operation is valid. The first step uses 13 and 11 from the start state. Then the result 2 is used with 7. Then the result 14 is used with 10. 

So, the first explore_operation would be 13-11=2, resulting in state (2,7,10). Then move_to_node to that state. Next, multiply 2*7=14, resulting in (10,14). Then move_to_node again, and add 10+14=24. 

But the code example might combine steps. Wait, the participant's transcript mentions each step: 13-11=2, then times 7 is 14, then plus 10 is 24. So each of these operations should be represented as separate steps.

So the code would first handle the subtraction, then the multiplication, then the addition. Each step adds a node and an edge in the graph. 

I need to make sure that each operation is correctly applied to the current state. For example, after the first operation, the state is (2,7,10). Then multiplying 2 and 7 gives 14, so the state becomes (10,14). Then adding them gives 24. 

So the code would start with the initial state, call explore_operation for each step, moving to the new states as needed. Also, the comments should reflect the transcript quotes. 

I should also check if any steps are skipped. The participant might have inferred intermediate steps, but according to the transcript, each operation is mentioned explicitly. So each operation should be captured in the code.

Okay, let's tackle this problem. The start state is [8,9,11,11], and the participant didn't submit a response, so they probably couldn't find a solution in the time given. The transcript shows their thought process as they try different operations.

First, the participant starts by trying ""eleven minus nine equals two."" That gives them a 2, but they mention that combining that with other numbers might not work. So I need to represent that operation in the graph. The resulting state would be (8, 11, 2) after subtracting 11-9=2. Wait, wait, original numbers are 8,9,11,11. So subtracting 11-9=2 would use one 11 and the 9, leaving 8 and the other 11. So the new state should be (8, 11, 2). 

Next, they try ""eleven and nine is 20"" which is 11+9=20. That uses 11 and 9, leaving 8 and 11. Wait, original state is [8,9,11,11]. So adding 11+9=20 would remove those two numbers, leaving 8 and the other 11. So new state is (8,11,20). Then they say they need four more, which might mean adding 20+4, but there's no 4. Maybe they tried something else.

Then they mention ""eleven and eight is 19,"" which is 11+8=19. That uses 11 and 8, leaving 9 and 11. So new state would be (9,11,19). They need five more, which might be adding 19+5, but again, no 5.

Looking at ""eleven plus eleven equals 22."" That's 11+11=22, leaving 8 and 9. So new state is (8,9,22). Then they subtract nine from 22: 22-9=13, then add 8 to get 21. So from (8,9,22), subtracting 9 gives 22-9=13, combining with remaining 8? Wait, original state after 11+11=22 is (8,9,22). Then 22-9=13, so removing 22 and 9, adding 13. New state would be (8,13). Then adding 8+13=21, but that's not part of the steps. Alternatively, maybe they did 22-9=13, then 13+8=21. So the state after 22-9=13 would be (8,13), then adding 8+13=21. But the transcript says ""21"" so maybe that's the next step.

They also try 22-8=14, which would leave 9 and 14. So from (8,9,22), subtracting 8 gives 22-8=14, resulting in (9,14). Then they say that doesn't make sense.

The participant seems to backtrack a lot, trying different combinations but not finding a path to 24. They mention it's a hard one, so maybe there's no solution, or they just couldn't find it.

Now, translating this into the graph. Each operation they try should be an edge from the current state to the new state. Each time they try an operation, even if it doesn't lead to the solution, we need to add that. Also, if they move back to a previous state (like backtracking), we use move_to_node.

So steps:

1. Start state (8,9,11,11).

2. First operation: 11 - 9 = 2. Resulting state (8,11,2). Use explore_operation here.

3. Then they try 11 + 9 =20. From start state again, so move back to start, then explore_operation 11+9=20, resulting in (8,11,20).

4. Next, 11 +8=19. From start state again, move_to_node(start_state), then explore_operation 11+8=19, resulting in (9,11,19).

5. Then 11+11=22. From start state, move_to_node(start_state), explore_operation 11+11=22, resulting in (8,9,22).

6. Then 22-9=13. Move to (8,9,22), then explore_operation 22-9=13, resulting in (8,13).

7. Then 13+8=21. Explore_operation 13+8=21, resulting in (21,).

8. Then they try 22-8=14. From (8,9,22), explore_operation 22-8=14, resulting in (9,14).

9. They mention needing 5 more to 19, maybe trying other combinations but not explicitly stated.

Each of these steps should be added as operations in the graph. Also, when they backtrack, like moving back to the start state, we need to use move_to_node.

Need to make sure that each operation uses numbers present in the current state. For example, when subtracting 11-9, the current state must have 11 and 9.

Also, check for any calculation errors. For example, if they said 11-9=3, that would be an error, but in this case, 11-9=2 is correct.

So the code would involve creating the graph, then each explore_operation and move_to_node as per their transcript.

Okay, let's see. The start state is [11,13,13,13], and the response given is (13-13)+11+13. The participant's transcript mentions doing 13 minus 13 first, which equals 0, then adding 11 and the remaining 13. 

First, I need to model the steps they took. The first operation they mentioned is 13-13=0. So in the initial state, there are three 13s and one 11. Using one 13 and another 13 to subtract gives 0, leaving the third 13 and 11. The resulting state after this operation would be (0, 11, 13).

Next, they add 0 + 11 +13. But adding those together would give 24. Wait, 0 +11 is 11, then adding 13 gives 24. But how does that work step by step? The participant might have combined the addition of 11 and 13 to the 0. However, each operation in the model combines two numbers. So maybe the steps are:

1. 13-13=0 → state (0,11,13)
2. 0+11=11 → state (11,13)
3. 11+13=24 → state (24,)

But the participant's response is written as (13-13)+11+13, which groups the subtraction first and then adds the remaining numbers. However, in the model, each operation must combine two numbers at a time. So the first step is correct. Then, adding 0 and 11 gives 11, then adding 11 and 13 gives 24. 

I need to represent each operation step. So first, the subtraction. Then, two additions. But the transcript mentions ""plus 11 plus that"", which might imply adding both 11 and the remaining 13 in one step, but according to the rules, each operation must be between two numbers. So splitting into two steps.

Wait, but the participant's final answer groups (13-13) + 11 +13. So maybe they combined the 0 with 11 and 13 in one step? But the model requires each operation to combine two numbers. So the code would need to first subtract two 13s, then add 0 and 11, then add that result with 13. 

So the code would first call explore_operation for 13-13=0, resulting in (0,11,13). Then move to that state, then add 0+11=11, resulting in (11,13). Then move again and add 11+13=24. 

Alternatively, maybe the participant considered adding all three numbers (0,11,13) in one step, but according to the guidelines, each operation must be between two numbers. So each step must combine two numbers. 

Therefore, the code should have three steps: subtract two 13s, add 0+11, then add 11+13. 

But the participant's response time was 29 seconds, so they probably found the solution quickly. The transcript mentions ""0 plus 11 plus that"", which might be combining 0, 11, and 13 in one step, but that's not allowed. So the code should break it into two additions. 

So the Python code would first perform the subtraction, then two additions. Each step needs to be an explore_operation. 

So the first operation is 13-13=0. Then, from the resulting state (0,11,13), the next operation is 0+11=11. Then, from (11,13), add them to get 24. 

Each of these steps would be an explore_operation. Also, after each operation, the code may need to move_to_node the new state to proceed. 

So the code would look like:

start_state = (11,13,13,13)
graph = GraphBuilder(start_state)
# First operation: 13-13=0
new_state1 = graph.explore_operation(start_state, ""13-13=0"", (0,11,13), ...)
# Move to new_state1
curr_state = graph.move_to_node(new_state1)
# Second operation: 0+11=11
new_state2 = graph.explore_operation(curr_state, ""0+11=11"", (11,13), ...)
# Move to new_state2
curr_state = graph.move_to_node(new_state2)
# Third operation: 11+13=24
new_state3 = graph.explore_operation(curr_state, ""11+13=24"", (24,), ...)

But the participant's response is (13-13)+11+13, which is equivalent to ((13-13)+11)+13. So the steps are correct. 

I need to make sure that each operation is valid and that the resulting states are correctly represented. Also, the comments should reflect the transcript. 

The transcript says: ""13 minus 13 is fine, which that equals 0 plus 11 plus that."" So the participant mentions the subtraction first, then adding 0 with 11 and 13. But the code must split into two steps. 

So the code should be written accordingly.

Okay, let's tackle this problem. The start state is [1,5,5,6], and the response given is (6x5)-(5+1). The participant's transcript has several steps, so I need to map each part to the operations in the code.

First, the participant says ""1 plus 5 is 6."" That's adding 1 and 5 to get 6. So I should use explore_operation for 1+5=6. The current state is (1,5,5,6), so after removing 1 and 5 and adding 6, the new state would be (5,6,6). 

Next, they mention ""6 and 6 is 36 minus 5."" Wait, 6 times 6 is 36, then subtract 5? But that would be 31. So operation here is 6*6=36, resulting in (5,36). Then subtracting 5 would be 36-5=31, but the transcript isn't clear if they did that. Maybe the participant tried 6*6 but realized it's not helpful.

Then, ""6 times 4 is 24. 6 times 4. Hmm. 6 times 4. 5 minus 1 is 4."" So they tried to get 4 by 5-1, then use 6*4. But 4 isn't in the original numbers. So they might have done 5-1=4, then 6*4=24. But wait, the original numbers are 1,5,5,6. If they use 5-1, that would leave another 5. So after 5-1=4, the state becomes (5,6,4). Then 6*4=24, but that leaves the other 5? Hmm, maybe not. The response they submitted was (6x5)-(5+1), which uses all numbers. So perhaps the initial steps were incorrect attempts.

The participant then says ""5 times 6 is 36 minus 1."" Wait, 5*6 is 30, not 36. So that's a calculation error. Then ""6 times 5 minus"" which is leading to the correct answer. 

So the correct path is: 6*5=30 and 5+1=6, then 30-6=24. So the operations would be first combining 5 and 1 via addition, then multiplying 6 and 5, then subtracting. But how to structure this in the code.

Wait, each operation combines two numbers. So to do (6*5) - (5+1), they need to first compute 5+1=6, then 6*5=30, then 30-6=24. But the order might vary. Alternatively, they might combine 6 and 5 first, then 5 and 1, then subtract.

But in the transcript, the participant mentions ""6 times 5 is 30 minus 6."" Which suggests that after computing 6*5=30, they subtract 6 (maybe from 5+1=6). So the steps would be:

1. 5+1=6 (using the two 5s and 1? Wait, original numbers are 1,5,5,6. So to get 5+1, they might have used one 5 and the 1. So resulting state would be (5,6,6) again. Then 6*5=30, leading to (6,30), then 30-6=24. But that uses only three numbers, leaving one 5? Wait, no. Let me think.

Wait, each operation must use two numbers from the current state. So the correct path would be:

Start with (1,5,5,6).

First, combine 5 and 1 to make 6 (5+1=6). Now the state is (5,6,6).

Then, combine 6 and 5 to make 30 (6*5=30). Now the state is (6,30).

Then, subtract 6 from 30 (30-6=24), but wait, that would use 6 and 30, leaving nothing. Wait, but the resulting state would be (24,). But how does that use all numbers? Because each step combines two numbers, replacing them with the result. So:

First step: 5 and 1 → 6. So remaining numbers are 5,6,6.

Second step: 6 and 5 → 30. Remaining numbers are 6 and 30.

Third step: 30 -6 =24. So the final state is (24). 

But the problem requires using all numbers exactly once. Wait, in the game of 24, you must use all four numbers exactly once. So each operation combines two numbers, reducing the count by one each time. Starting with four numbers, you need three operations. 

So the correct approach would be:

First, 5 +1 =6 → state becomes (5,6,6).

Then, 6 *5 =30 → state becomes (6,30).

Then, 30 -6 =24. But this uses all four numbers? Wait, no. Because the first operation uses 5 and 1, the second uses 6 and 5 (but wait, the 5 here is the remaining one after the first step). Wait, in the first step, we have two 5s. So first operation uses one 5 and 1. Then the second operation uses the other 5 and 6. Then the third uses 30 and 6. But that would leave all numbers used. Hmm, maybe.

Alternatively, maybe the participant combined 6 and 5 first (to get 30), then 5+1 (to get 6), then subtract those two 6s. But that would not reach 24. 

Alternatively, the correct solution is (6*5) - (5+1). So the steps would be:

1. Combine 6 and 5 → 30. State: (1,5,30).

2. Combine 5 and 1 →6. State: (30,6).

3. Subtract 6 from 30 →24. 

So in code, this would be:

First, explore_operation on start_state with 6*5=30, resulting in (1,5,30).

Then, move_to_node to (1,5,30), then explore_operation 5+1=6, resulting in (30,6).

Then, move_to_node to (30,6), then explore_operation 30-6=24.

But in the transcript, the participant says ""6 times 5 minus (5+1)"", which suggests that they did 6*5 and 5+1 first, then subtracted. But how to do that in sequence since each operation reduces the numbers.

Alternatively, the participant might have done:

First, 5+1=6, leading to (5,6,6).

Then, 6*5=30 (using one 6 and the 5), leading to (6,30).

Then 30-6=24.

Either way, the code needs to represent these steps.

Looking at the transcript, the participant mentions ""5 minus 1 is 4"" at one point, which is an incorrect path. Then later says ""5 times 6 is 36 minus 1"" which is a miscalculation (5*6=30). But the correct path is in their response.

So the code should capture the correct steps leading to the solution. The participant might have tried several wrong paths but eventually found the right one.

So in the code:

Start with (1,5,5,6).

First, they tried ""1 plus 5 is 6"" → operation 1+5=6, resulting in (5,6,6).

Then, ""6 and 6 is 36 minus 5"" → which would be 6*6=36, resulting in (5,36). Then 36-5=31, but that's not helpful.

Then, ""5 minus 1 is 4"" → 5-1=4, leading to (5,6,4). Then 6*4=24, but that leaves the other 5, so resulting state would be (5,24). Then maybe subtract 5? Not sure.

But the correct path is in their response. So eventually, they did 6*5=30 and 5+1=6, then subtract.

So perhaps:

After some wrong steps, the participant goes back and does:

From start_state, do 5+1=6 (using one 5 and 1), then 6*5=30 (using the remaining 5 and 6), then 30-6=24.

So code steps:

start_state = (1,5,5,6)

explore_operation for 1+5=6 → resulting_state (5,6,6).

Then move_to_node to (5,6,6), then explore_operation 6*5=30 → resulting_state (6,30).

Then move_to_node to (6,30), explore_operation 30-6=24.

But in the transcript, the participant says ""6 times 5",qwen3-235b-a22b,,False,,False,,

Okay, let's see. The user provided a start state of [4,4,9,11] and the response is ((11-9)+4)x4. The transcript shows the participant working through different operations. 

First, they tried 4*4=16, then added 11 to get 27, and mentioned subtracting 9 which doesn't work. Then they considered 11-9=2, added 4 to get 6, and multiplied by the remaining 4 to reach 24. 

So, the steps are: subtract 9 from 11 to get 2, add 4 to get 6, then multiply by 4. The graph needs to represent each of these operations. 

I need to break down each operation step by step. The first operation is 11-9=2. Then adding 4 to that result (2+4=6). Then multiplying by 4 (6*4=24). Each of these steps should be an explore_operation. 

Wait, but in the code, each explore_operation replaces two numbers with the result. So for 11-9=2, the resulting state would be (4,4,2). Then adding 4 to 2 would require combining 2 and 4, leading to 6, and the state becomes (4,6). Then multiplying them gives 24. 

But the participant's transcript mentions using parentheses, so the order is important. Let me structure each step properly. 

First, subtract 9 from 11: operation ""11-9=2"", resulting state (4,4,2). Then add 4 to 2: ""2+4=6"", resulting state (4,6). Then multiply 4 and 6: ""4*6=24"". 

Each of these steps should be individual explore_operation calls. Also, the participant backtracks if they tried something else, but in this case, they seem to go straight to the solution. 

I need to make sure that each operation is correctly represented, and the resulting states are tracked. Also, the final operation should lead to (24,). 

Let me check the code example again. The explore_operation function takes curr_state, operation string, resulting_state, and comment. 

So, step by step:

1. Start at (4,4,9,11). Explore ""11-9=2"", resulting in (4,4,2).
2. Move to (4,4,2), then explore ""4+2=6"" (but wait, which 4? Since there are two 4s, but the participant probably uses one. So combining 4 and 2 to get 6, resulting in (4,6).
3. Then move to (4,6) and explore ""4*6=24"".

Alternatively, the participant might have added the 4 to the 2 first, then multiplied. 

Wait, the transcript says: ""11 minus 9 would be 2, plus 4 is 6"". So 2 +4=6. Then multiply by the remaining 4. So the steps are:

- 11-9=2 (state (4,4,2))
- 2+4=6 (using one of the 4s, state (4,6))
- 4*6=24 (state (24,))

Yes. So each of these steps is a separate explore_operation. 

So in the code:

First, curr_state is start_state. Then explore_operation for 11-9=2. Then move_to_node on the new state. Then explore_operation for 2+4=6. Then move_to_node again, then explore_operation for 4*6=24.

I need to code each of these steps, making sure the states are correctly updated. Also, comments should reflect the transcript quotes.

Okay, let's tackle this problem. The start state is [2,2,7,10], and the participant didn't submit a response, so they probably couldn't find a solution. Let me go through the transcript step by step.

First, the participant says, ""7 times 2 is 14 plus 10 equals 24, but that leaves out the last 2."" So they tried 7*2=14, then 14+10=24. But since there's another 2 left, that's not valid. So I need to represent that operation. The current state is (2,2,7,10). They used 7 and 2 to make 14, so the resulting state would be (2,10,14). Then adding 10 and 14 gives 24, but there's still a 2 left. Wait, but the participant mentions leaving out the last 2, so maybe after 7*2=14, the state is (2,10,14), then adding 14+10=24 would leave the 2 unused. So the first operation is 7*2=14, leading to (2,10,14). Then they tried adding 14+10=24, but that would ignore the remaining 2. So the next operation would be 14+10=24, resulting in (2,24), but the participant realizes that's not allowed because all numbers must be used. Hmm, maybe the code should capture that.

Next, they try ""10 times 2 equals 20. Can't get 24 without any other weighting combos there."" So 10*2=20, resulting in (2,7,20). Then maybe trying to add 20+7+2=29, but that's not helpful. Then they mention trying to get 7 from 2s, which might be 2+2+ something. Then they talk about 48 divided by 2, which might be a miscalculation. Also, trying 7+2=9, times 2=18, but that's 18, leaving out the 2. Wait, the transcript has some confusing parts. 

The participant also says, ""10 minus 2 is 8. 9. And..."" which might be trying 10-2=8, then combining with 7 and 2. For example, 8*(something). Let me parse each part carefully.

So, step by step:

1. 7*2=14 (using one 2 and 7), state becomes (2,10,14)
2. Then 14+10=24, but leaves 2, which is invalid. So the operation would be 14+10=24, resulting in (2,24), but since all numbers must be used, this is incorrect. The code should mark this as an error.

Then they try 10*2=20, state (2,7,20). Then maybe 20+7+2=29, but that's not helpful. Then they mention trying to get 7 from 2s, which might be 2+2+ something, but that's not possible. Then they talk about 48 divided by 2, which might be a miscalculation of 24*2=48, but dividing by 2 gives 24. But how to get 48 from the numbers.

Another part: ""7 plus 2 is 9. 19. Did I try 1? Nope. Hmm. So, 11. 9. 7 plus 2 plus 2. 11. 9. 18. 28."" This seems like they're trying various combinations but not succeeding.

Finally, they try ""10 minus 2 is 8. 9. And..."" which might be 10-2=8, then 8*(something). Maybe 8*3=24, but how to get 3 from 2 and 7. Like 7-2-2=3? Let's see: 7-2=5, then 5-2=3. Then 8*3=24. But the participant didn't mention that. Maybe they tried that but didn't find it.

So in the code, each of these operations should be captured. For example:

- 7*2=14 leading to (2,10,14)
- Then 14+10=24 leading to (2,24) which is invalid
- 10*2=20 leading to (2,7,20)
- Then maybe 20+7+2=29 leading to (29,)
- Trying 7-2=5 leading to (2,5,10)
- Then 5-2=3 leading to (3,10)
- Then 10-2=8 leading to (7,8,2)
- Then 8*(something) like 8*3=24 if they can get 3 from remaining numbers.

But the participant didn't find the solution, so the code should represent all the attempts they made, even if incorrect.

Also, note that the correct solution might be (10-2)* (7-2) = 8*5=40, which isn't 24. Wait, maybe another approach. Let me check possible solutions for [2,2,7,10]. One possible solution is (7 - (10/2)) * 2 = (7-5)*2=4, no. Or 2*2*(10 -7)= 4*3=12. Not 24. Hmm, maybe there's no solution. But the participant might have thought there is one.

Alternatively, 10 + 7 + 2 + 2 =13, no. 10*2 +7 -2= 20+5=25. Not. Maybe (2+2)* (10 -7)=4*3=12. Still no. Wait, perhaps the problem is unsolvable, which is why the participant couldn't find a solution. If that's the case, the code should show all their attempts but no path to 24.

So in the code, each operation they tried should be added, even if incorrect, and the graph would end without reaching 24.

Okay, let's see. The user provided a start state of [1,2,5,7], and the response is (7-2)x5-1. The transcript says that the target is 24. The participant mentions 7-2=5, then 5 times 5 is 25 minus 1. Wait, but the start state has 7,2,5,1. So let me break this down step by step.

First, the participant starts with 7-2. That's correct because both numbers are in the initial state. So subtracting 2 from 7 gives 5. Now the state becomes [1,5,5] because we used 7 and 2, and added the result 5. 

Next, they multiply that 5 by the existing 5 in the original state. Wait, but wait. The original state has 5 as one of the numbers. But after the first operation, we have two 5s? Because we used 7 and 2 to make 5, so the remaining numbers are 1 and 5. Wait, original start state is [1,2,5,7]. So when we do 7-2=5, we replace 7 and 2 with 5. So the new state should be [1,5,5]. So the two 5s are there. Then multiplying those two 5s gives 25. But wait, the participant says ""5 times 5 is 25"", which would be correct. Then subtract 1 to get 24. 

So the operations are: (7-2) =5, then 5*5=25, then 25-1=24. But in the response, it's written as (7-2)x5-1. Wait, the response groups (7-2) and then multiplies by 5, then subtracts 1. So the order is (5)*5 -1. But in the transcript, the participant mentions 5 times 5 is 25 minus 1. So the steps are correct. 

So in the code, we need to model each operation step. The first operation is 7-2=5. Then, multiply that result (5) with the remaining 5 (from the original state?), but wait, after the first operation, the state is [1,5,5]. Then the next operation would be 5*5=25, which uses two 5s, resulting in 25, leaving 1. Then subtract 1 from 25. 

Wait, but each operation must combine two numbers. So the steps would be:

1. 7-2=5 → new state [1,5,5]
2. 5*5=25 → new state [1,25]
3. 25-1=24 → new state [24]

But the participant's transcript says ""5 times 5 is 25 minus 1"", which combines the two steps into one. However, according to the rules, each operation must be a single step combining two numbers. So the code should break this into individual operations.

So first, the participant does 7-2=5. Then, in the new state [1,5,5], they multiply the two 5s to get 25, leading to state [1,25]. Then subtract 1 from 25 to get 24. 

But in the transcript, the participant says ""7 minus 2 is 5. 5 times 5 is 25 minus 1."" So they mention each step. Therefore, the code should have three operations: subtract, multiply, then subtract. However, the response given is (7-2)x5-1, which is equivalent to ((7-2)*5) -1. Wait, that's different from the steps the participant described. Wait, the response is (7-2)x5-1, which would be (5)*5 -1 =24. But according to the transcript, the participant first does 7-2=5, then 5*5=25, then 25-1=24. So the response is indeed (7-2)*5 -1, which is 5*5=25-1=24. But in the steps, the participant uses the 5 from the first operation and the original 5. So the code needs to model each operation step by step.

So in the code:

Start state (1,2,5,7). 

First operation: 7-2=5 → new state (1,5,5). 

Then, multiply the two 5s: 5*5=25 → new state (1,25). 

Then subtract 1 from 25: 25-1=24. 

But the participant's response is written as (7-2)x5 -1. Wait, but in that case, the 5 in the multiplication is the original 5. So after the first operation (7-2=5), the state has two 5s (the result and the original). Then multiplying those two gives 25, then subtract 1. 

Therefore, the code should have three steps. However, the participant's transcript might have combined the multiplication and subtraction into one step. But according to the problem's instructions, each operation is a single step. So the code should break it down into each individual operation.

So the code would first call explore_operation for 7-2=5, then in the new state, multiply 5*5=25, then subtract 1. 

But the response given by the participant is (7-2)x5-1, which is a single expression. However, according to the rules, each operation combines two numbers. So the code must represent each step. 

Therefore, the code should first do 7-2=5, then multiply that 5 with the existing 5 to get 25, then subtract 1. 

So in the code:

start_state = (1,2,5,7)
curr_state = start_state

First, explore_operation for 7-2=5, resulting in (1,5,5).

Then, move_to_node to (1,5,5), then explore_operation for 5*5=25, resulting in (1,25).

Then, move_to_node to (1,25), then explore_operation for 25-1=24.

But the participant's transcript says ""5 times 5 is 25 minus 1"", which might imply that they did 5*5-1, but that's two operations: multiply then subtract. So each step is separate.

So the code should have these three steps. However, the participant's response is written as (7-2)x5 -1, which is equivalent to ((7-2)*5) -1. But in that case, the multiplication is between the result of 7-2 (5) and the original 5. So the code should first do 7-2=5, then multiply the two 5s. 

But wait, the original start state has 5 as one of the numbers. So after 7-2=5, the state is [1,5 (from 7-2),5 (original)]. So multiplying those two 5s gives 25. Then subtract 1. 

Therefore, the code should be:

start_state = (1,2,5,7)
curr_state = start_state
graph = GraphBuilder(curr_state)

# First operation: 7-2=5
new_state1 = graph.explore_operation(
    curr_state,
    operation=""7-2=5"",
    resulting_state=(1,5,5),
    comment=""Participant subtracts 2 from 7 to get 5.""
)

# Move to new_state1
curr_state = graph.move_to_node(new_state1)

# Second operation: multiply the two 5s to get 25
new_state2 = graph.explore_operation(
    curr_state,
    operation=""5*5=25"",
    resulting_state=(1,25),
    comment=""Participant multiplies the two 5s to get 25.""
)

# Move to new_state2
curr_state = graph.move_to_node(new_state2)

# Third operation: subtract 1 from 25
new_state3 = graph.explore_operation(
    curr_state,
    operation=""25-1=24"",
    resulting_state=(24,),
    comment=""Participant subtracts 1 from 25 to reach 24.""
)

But the participant's response is written as (7-2)x5-1. Wait, in that expression, the multiplication is between (7-2) and 5, which is the original 5. So after 7-2=5, multiplying by original 5 gives 25, then subtract 1. So the steps are the same as above. However, in the code above, the multiplication is between the two 5s (the result and original). So the code is correct. 

But in the transcript, the participant says ""5 times 5 is 25 minus 1"", which aligns with multiplying the two 5s and then subtracting 1. So the code correctly represents the steps. 

Therefore, the code should be structured with these three operations.

Okay, let's tackle this problem. The start state is [1,5,9,10], and the response given is 5+10+(1x9). The transcript has some confusing parts, but I need to map the participant's thought process into the graph structure.

First, the participant starts by saying ""10 plus 5 equals 10."" Wait, that's not correct. 10+5 is 15, but they might have made a mistake here. So I should note that as an incorrect calculation. The resulting state would be (1,9,15), but since the operation is wrong, mark it as a result_calc_error.

Next, they mention ""25 plus 9, 14, 11, 9 plus 5, 14 plus 10, 6 plus 9 plus 10, 1 plus 9 plus 10."" This part is a bit jumbled. Maybe they tried different combinations but didn't articulate each step clearly. For example, ""9 plus 5"" would be 14, so that's an operation. Then ""14 plus 10"" would be 24, which is the target. But the participant might have been exploring different additions here. However, since the transcript isn't clear on the exact operations, I might need to infer based on the final response.

The participant also says ""5 plus 4 times 9,"" but 4 isn't in the start state. That might be a mistake. Alternatively, maybe they meant 5 + (something else). Then ""10 plus 9 plus 10"" which uses 10 twice, which isn't allowed. So these might be errors or transcription issues.

The final response is 5+10+(1x9). Let's break that down. First, 1x9=9, then adding 5 and 10. So the operations would be 1*9=9, leading to the state (5,10,9), then adding them all: 5+10+9=24. But since each operation combines two numbers, the participant probably did 1*9 first, then added 5 and 10.

So steps in code:

1. Start with (1,5,9,10).
2. Explore 1*9=9, resulting in (5,9,10). Wait, no: combining 1 and 9 gives 9, so the new state is (5,9,10). Then add 5+10+9. But each operation combines two numbers. So after getting 9 from 1*9, the next step would be 5+10=15, leading to (15,9), then 15+9=24. Or maybe 5+10=15, then 15+9=24. But the participant's final answer is written as 5+10+(1x9), which implies three separate additions. However, in the game, each operation combines two numbers, so the steps would be:

First operation: 1*9=9 → state (5,9,10)
Second operation: 5+10=15 → state (9,15)
Third operation: 9+15=24 → state (24)

Alternatively, maybe the participant combined 5+10 first, then added the 9. Let's structure the code accordingly.

In the transcript, the participant mentions ""1 times 9"" towards the end. So that's the key step. The other parts might be incorrect attempts.

So the correct path would be:

- 1*9=9 (correct operation)
- Then 5+10=15 (correct)
- Then 15+9=24 (correct)

But the code needs to represent each operation step. So in the code:

First, explore_operation for 1*9=9, resulting in (5,10,9). Then move_to_node that state, then explore_operation 5+10=15, resulting in (9,15). Then move_to_node and explore_operation 9+15=24.

But the participant's final response is written as 5+10+(1x9), which is equivalent to (5+10)+(1*9). So the order might be combining 5+10 first, then combining with 9.

Wait, but in the game, you have to use all four numbers exactly once. So each operation reduces the count by one. Starting with four numbers:

First operation: combine two → three numbers left.

Second operation: combine two of those three → two numbers left.

Third operation: combine the last two → one number (24).

So for the correct answer (5+10)+(1*9), the steps would be:

1. 1*9=9 → state becomes (5,10,9)
2. 5+10=15 → state becomes (15,9)
3. 15+9=24 → done.

Alternatively, 5+10=15 first, then 15 + (1*9)=24.

Either way, the code needs to capture these steps.

In the transcript, the participant says ""1 times 9"" at the end, so maybe they first did 1*9, then added 5+10, then combined.

So in the code:

Start state.

Explore operation 1*9=9 → new state (5,9,10).

Move to that state.

Explore operation 5+10=15 → new state (9,15).

Move to that state.

Explore operation 9+15=24 → new state (24).

But the transcript's exact words are ""5+10+(1x9)"", which suggests that they combined 5 and 10 after having the 9 from 1*9. So the code steps would be as above.

Other parts of the transcript mention incorrect operations, like ""10 plus 5 equals 10"" (which is wrong), so those would be added as incorrect steps.

So putting it all together:

- First, the incorrect ""10+5=10"" (but that's 15, so result_calc_error=True)
- Then the correct steps as outlined.

But the participant's final response is correct, so the code should show the correct path leading to that response.

Okay, let's tackle this problem. The start state is [5,6,8,13], and the participant didn't submit a response, so they probably couldn't find a solution in time. The transcript shows their thought process.

First, the participant mentions trying to get to 4 because 8 times 3 would be 24, but they need to make 3 from 13,5,6. They tried 13-5-6=2, which doesn't help. Then they tried 13-5=8, leading to 8+8+6=22, which is close but not 24. 

Next, they considered 13-6=7, which doesn't help. They thought about 8*6=48, but then 48 divided by something? They have 13 and 5 left, but that's not useful. Then 13*5=65, which is too big. Adding 5+8=13, then 13+13=26, which is over. 

They also tried 5+6=11, then adding 8 and 13, but that's 32. Then 13-6+5=12, plus 8 is 20. Still not there. 

So, the participant is exploring various combinations but not finding a valid path. The correct solution might involve operations that they didn't consider. Let's see if there's a valid solution for this set. 

Looking at the numbers 5,6,8,13. Possible solutions could be:

- (13 - 5) * (8 - 6) = 8 * 2 = 16. No.
- (13 + 5) / (8 / 6) → 18 / (1.333) ≈ 13.5. No.
- 8*(5 - (13-6)/something). Wait, 13-6=7, 7-5=2. Not helpful. 

Wait, maybe (13 - (8 / (6 / 5))) → but that's complicated. Let me check:

Alternatively, 6/(13-(5*8/ something? Hmm. Maybe not. Let me check if this set is actually solvable. 

Wait, according to some 24 game solvers, possible solutions for 5,6,8,13:

One possible solution is 8 * (5 - (13 - 6)/ something? Wait, let me compute:

Wait, 13 - 5 = 8. Then 8 + 8 = 16, plus 6 is 22. Not working. 

Another approach: 6 * 8 = 48. 48 / (13 - 5) = 48 /8 =6. Then 6 + something? Not 24.

Wait, maybe (13 + 5 - 8) * (6 / something). 13+5=18-8=10. 10 *6=60. No. 

Hmm, maybe this set isn't solvable. But the participant is trying hard. The code needs to reflect their attempts. 

In the transcript, the participant sets a subgoal of getting to 4 (since 8*3=24). They tried making 3 from 13,5,6. So code should set a subgoal for (8,3). Then they tried 13-5-6=2 (but that's 2, which they didn't use). Then 13-5=8, leading to 8+8+6=22. Then 8*6=48, etc. 

So the code should create nodes for each operation they tried, even if incorrect. Also, backtracking when they realize a path isn't working. Also, setting subgoals when they mention working backward (like 24/8=3, so need to make 3). 

Need to map each step in the transcript into code, using explore_operation and set_subgoal where appropriate. Also, handle calculation errors if they made any.

Okay, let's tackle this problem. The start state is [8,9,9,12], and the participant's response was ""8+9"", which is incomplete. They ran out of time, so the transcript shows they struggled a lot.

First, I need to parse the transcript. The participant starts by trying ""12-9 is 3"", then ""3-9 is 12"" which doesn't make sense. Maybe they meant 3*(something). Then they mention trying to make 5 with 12, 20+9=31 minus 9=22. That's confusing. They also tried 12+9=21, then 29-9=20? Not sure. 

They said ""9 plus 8 17 plus 12 29"", so 9+8=17, 17+12=29. Then they mention 12*8=96, 96-81=15. That seems like a stretch. There's a lot of backtracking and confusion here.

I need to map each step into the graph. The first operation they tried was 12-9=3. Then they tried combining that 3 with another number. But they made errors, like ""3-9 is 12"", which is incorrect. Maybe they meant 3* something. 

They also mentioned trying to make 5, which might be a subgoal. Then there's the 9+8=17, which is correct, but they didn't use all numbers. The final response was 8+9, which is 17, not 24, so it's wrong.

I should create nodes for each state they explored. For example, starting state (8,9,9,12). After 12-9=3, the state becomes (3,8,9). Then trying 3-9=... but that's invalid. Maybe they tried 3* something but messed up. 

They also tried 12+9=21, leading to (8,9,21). Then 21+...? They mentioned 22, maybe adding 1? Not sure. 

The part where they do 12*8=96 would create a state (9,9,96), but that's a wrong calculation. Then subtracting 81 (maybe 9*9) gives 15, leading to (15, 8). 

They also set a subgoal maybe when they said ""try to make 5"", but it's unclear. 

Each operation in the transcript should be an edge. Even incorrect steps are important. The code should use explore_operation for each attempt, move_to_node when they backtrack. 

Need to handle the errors as per the guidelines, not correcting them but marking result_calc_error=True. Also, some steps might involve multiple operations, like combining numbers in parentheses. 

So, the Python code should start with the initial state, then each operation as per their statements, creating new states and edges. Even if they didn't reach the solution, all their attempts are part of the graph.

Okay, let's see. The participant is given the numbers [1,4,12,12] and they need to make 24. Their response was ((4-1)x12)-12. Let me break down how they might have gotten there based on the transcript.

First, the transcript starts with them saying they don't know how to do it and that they're terrible at math. They mention 1 over 12 is 24, which doesn't make sense mathematically. Then they say ""4 minus 1 times 12"" and ""12 minus 12"". 

So, the key steps here are probably starting with 4-1. Let's check that. 4-1 is 3. Then multiplying by 12 gives 36. Then subtracting the other 12 would get 24. That matches their final answer. 

In the code, I need to represent each operation step. The initial state is (1,4,12,12). First, they do 4-1=3. That would create a new state (3,12,12). Then multiply 3 by 12 to get 36, leading to (12,36). Wait, no, because each operation combines two numbers. Wait, when you do 4-1, you replace those two numbers with the result, so the state becomes (3,12,12). Then taking 3 and 12, multiplying gives 36, so state becomes (12,36). Then subtracting the remaining 12? Wait, no. Wait, the original problem uses all four numbers. Let me think again.

Wait, the correct solution uses all numbers: 4-1 uses two numbers, then multiply by 12 (using the third number), then subtract the last 12. Wait, but each operation combines two numbers each time. So the steps would be:

1. 4 - 1 = 3. Now the numbers are 3, 12, 12.
2. 3 * 12 = 36. Now the numbers are 36, 12.
3. 36 - 12 = 24. Now the numbers are 24.

So in the code, each of these steps needs to be represented as operations. The participant might have thought of combining 4-1 first, then multiplying by 12, then subtracting the other 12. 

Looking at the transcript, they mention ""4 minus 1 times 12"" which could be (4-1)*12, and then subtract 12. So in the code, the first operation is 4-1=3, leading to (3,12,12). Then multiply 3*12=36, leading to (12,36). Then subtract 12 from 36 to get 24. Wait, but that would leave the other 12. Hmm, maybe the steps are:

After 4-1=3, then combine 3 and 12 (the first 12) to multiply, getting 36, then subtract the other 12. So the states would be:

Start: (1,4,12,12)
After 4-1=3: (3,12,12)
Then 3*12=36: (12,36)
Then 36-12=24: (24)

But how does the code handle multiple steps? Each operation is between two numbers in the current state. So each step should be a separate explore_operation call.

So first, the participant does 4-1=3. Then, they multiply that 3 by one of the 12s. Then subtract the remaining 12.

In the code:

First, start_state = (1,4,12,12). Then:

new_state1 = explore_operation(start_state, ""4-1=3"", (3,12,12), ...)

Then move_to_node(new_state1), then explore_operation to multiply 3*12=36, resulting in (12,36). Then move_to_node that state, then explore_operation 36-12=24.

But the participant's final answer is ((4-1)*12) -12. So the code should capture each of these steps. Also, the transcript mentions ""4 minus 1 times 12. 12 minus 12."" So they might have combined the steps in their mind, but the code needs to break it down into individual operations.

So the code should have three steps: subtract 4-1, multiply by 12, subtract the other 12. Each operation is a separate edge in the graph.

I need to make sure that each operation uses exactly two numbers from the current state and replaces them with the result. So each step reduces the count of numbers by one each time.

Yes. So the code would first do 4-1=3, then 3*12=36, then 36-12=24. Each of these steps is an explore_operation. The transcript might not explicitly mention each step, but the final answer implies that they did these steps.

So in the code:

start_state = (1,4,12,12)

curr_state = start_state

First operation: 4-1=3. Resulting state (3,12,12)

Then, move to that state and multiply 3*12=36. Resulting state (12,36)

Then move to that state and subtract 12, resulting in 24.

But the participant's transcript says ""4 minus 1 times 12. 12 minus 12."" which seems to combine the steps. So the code should capture each individual step.

So the code would have:

graph = GraphBuilder(start_state)

new_state1 = graph.explore_operation(start_state, ""4-1=3"", (3,12,12), ...)

curr_state = graph.move_to_node(new_state1)

new_state2 = graph.explore_operation(curr_state, ""3*12=36"", (12,36), ...)

curr_state = graph.move_to_node(new_state2)

new_state3 = graph.explore_operation(curr_state, ""36-12=24"", (24,), ...)

That would correctly model the steps taken. The comments should reference the transcript where possible.

Also, the participant mentions ""4 minus 1 times 12"" which could be ambiguous, but the correct parsing is (4-1)*12, then subtract 12. So each of these steps is captured in the code.

I need to make sure that the code correctly represents each operation and the resulting states. Also, check for any possible errors in the transcript, but in this case, the participant's final answer is correct, so the steps should be accurate.

Okay, let's see. The participant is working on the problem with the numbers [1,4,7,12] and their response was (7-4-1)x12. The response time was 93 seconds. The transcript shows some confusion and backtracking.

First, the participant starts by saying ""This one is tough. This one is 3. Oh, right. I get this one."" They mention 7 minus 4 is 3, then subtract 1 to get 2. Then they say ""2 times 12"" which would be 24. But then they get confused, saying ""It should be 2. This one is 3... So why is it incorrect?"" Maybe they thought they made a mistake but then tried again.

Looking at the operations, the correct path is 7-4-1=2, then 2x12=24. The transcript has the participant trying different combinations, maybe making errors in their calculations. For example, they mention ""3 minus 3 times 12"" which doesn't work, so they backtrack to subtract 1 again. 

I need to model their steps in the graph. The first step is exploring 7-4=3, leading to state (1,3,12). Then subtracting 1 from 3 gives 2, resulting in (2,12). Finally, multiplying those gives 24. 

Wait, but the transcript also has some confusing parts like ""minus 2"" and other comments. The participant might have made some incorrect steps but eventually corrected themselves. The code should reflect the correct operations they submitted, even if they had some wrong attempts in between.

So, the correct operations are:

1. 7-4=3
2. 3-1=2
3. 2*12=24

Each step should be an explore_operation. Also, after each operation, they might move_to_node the new state. The code should capture these steps, even if the participant had some incorrect thoughts in between. The errors in the transcript (like thinking 3-1*12 is wrong) are handled by the code's operations, and the result_calc_error flag can be set if needed. But in this case, the participant's final answer is correct, so the operations should be accurate.

I need to structure the Python code with the GraphBuilder, starting from the initial state, then each operation step by step. Also, handle moving between nodes if they backtrack. But in this case, the participant seems to proceed linearly towards the correct solution after some initial confusion.

Okay, let's tackle this problem. The start state is [2,3,6,7], and the response given is (7x3)-6+2. The response time was 180 seconds, which means the participant ran out of time. The transcript is a bit jumbled, but I need to parse through it to create the Python code that represents their thought process.

First, looking at the transcript: The participant starts counting from 1 to 30+, which might indicate they're trying different combinations or just thinking aloud. Then they mention ""6 times 2 plus 3 plus 7."" Let's break that down. 6*2 is 12, then adding 3 and 7 would give 22. But that's not 24. Then they say ""10, 12, no, it's 21, 7, 6 times 2 is 12. Plus 3. It's 12. 7 and 3 is 21."" Hmm, maybe they tried 7*3 which is 21, then subtract or add something. Then they mention ""7 times 3. Damn it. 7 times 3. 6 plus 2."" So 7*3 is 21, and 6+2 is 8. Maybe they tried combining those numbers.

The correct answer is (7*3)-6+2 = 21-6+2=17, which actually doesn't equal 24. Wait, that's odd. Wait, maybe the response is incorrect? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding. Wait, 7*3 is 21, minus 6 is 15, plus 2 is 17. That's not 24. Wait, maybe the actual correct equation is different. Let me check again. Oh, maybe the participant made a mistake in their response. Alternatively, maybe the correct equation is (7*3) + (6/2) or something else. Wait, the problem states the response is (7x3)-6+2, but that equals 17. So either the participant's answer is wrong, or there's a miscalculation. But according to the problem, that's the response they submitted. So regardless of correctness, we need to model their thought process.

Looking back at the transcript, the participant might have tried several operations. They mentioned 6*2=12, then adding 3 and 7. But that gives 12+3+7=22. Then they talk about 7*3=21. Then ""6 plus 2"" which is 8. Maybe they tried combining 21 with 8 somehow. But 21 + 8 is 29, which isn't 24. Alternatively, subtracting: 21 -8 =13. Not helpful.

Wait, maybe they tried (7*3) which is 21, then subtract 6 to get 15, then add 2 to get 17. But that's not 24. So perhaps the participant didn't find the correct solution and submitted an incorrect answer. However, the task is to model their transcript into code, not to find the correct solution.

In the transcript, the participant says ""7 times 3. Damn it. 7 times 3. 6 plus 2."" So they might have tried 7*3=21, then 6+2=8, and then maybe tried to combine 21 and 8. For example, 21 - (8) =13, or 21 +8=29, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, 21 - (6+2) =13. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe they tried different operations. Let's parse the transcript step by step.

The participant starts by counting up, which might indicate they're trying different numbers. Then they mention ""6 times 2 plus 3 plus 7."" So 6*2=12, then 12+3+7=22. Then they say ""10, 12, no, it's 21, 7, 6 times 2 is 12. Plus 3. It's 12. 7 and 3 is 21."" So here, they might have tried 7*3=21. Then ""Damn it. 7 times 3. 6 plus 2."" So perhaps they tried 7*3=21, then 6+2=8, and then tried to do 21 + (something with 8), but not sure.

The correct answer for the start state [2,3,6,7] is actually possible? Let me check. Let's see: 7*3=21. Then 21 - (6/2) = 21-3=18. Not 24. Alternatively, (6 - (7-3)) *2 = (6-4)*2=2*2=4. No. How about (7 - (6/3)) *2 = (7-2)*2=5*2=10. No. Maybe (6+7-3)*2=10*2=20. Not. Hmm. Wait, 3*(7 - (6/2))? 6/2=3, 7-3=4, 3*4=12. No. Maybe 6*2 + 3 +7=12+10=22. Close. Alternatively, 7*3 + (6/2)=21+3=24. Oh! That's 24. So 7*3 + 6/2 =21 +3=24. So the correct equation would be (7*3)+(6/2)=24. But the participant's response was (7x3)-6+2, which is 21-6+2=17. So the participant might have made a mistake. But according to the problem, their response was (7x3)-6+2, which is incorrect. But regardless, we need to model their transcript.

So in the transcript, the participant tried various operations. Let's map each part to code.

First, they mention ""6 times 2 plus 3 plus 7."" So operation: 6*2=12, resulting state (3,7,12). Then adding 3 and 7: 12+3+7=22, which would be 22. But how to model that. Wait, each operation combines two numbers. So first, 6*2=12, then combining 3+7=10, then combining 12 and 10 to get 22. But the code needs to model each step.

Alternatively, the participant might have done 6*2=12, then 12+3=15, then 15+7=22. Each step would be separate operations.

But according to the code structure, each explore_operation replaces two numbers with the result. So for example, first, take 6 and 2, multiply to get 12, resulting state (3,7,12). Then take 3 and 7, add to get 10, resulting state (10,12). Then add 10+12=22. But the transcript might not have explicitly mentioned all these steps.

Alternatively, the participant might have said ""6 times 2 plus 3 plus 7"" as a single operation, but the code requires each operation to combine two numbers. So the code would need to break it down into steps.

But the transcript is a bit unclear. Let's proceed step by step.

The code starts with the initial state (2,3,6,7). Then:

1. ""6 times 2 plus 3 plus 7."" The participant might have done 6*2=12 first. So:

new_state = graph.explore_operation(
    curr_state,
    operation=""6*2=12"",
    resulting_state=(3,7,12),
    comment=""6 times 2"",
)

Then, moving to that state, they add 3+7=10:

curr_state = graph.move_to_node(new_state)
new_state = graph.explore_operation(
    curr_state,
    operation=""3+7=10"",
    resulting_state=(10,12),
    comment=""plus 3 plus 7"",
)

Then, adding those two:

curr_state = graph.move_to_node(new_state)
new_state = graph.explore_operation(
    curr_state,
    operation=""10+12=22"",
    resulting_state=(22,),
    comment=""summing to 22"",
)

But the transcript says ""10, 12, no, it's 21, 7, 6 times 2 is 12. Plus 3. It's 12. 7 and 3 is 21."" So maybe they tried different combinations. For example, after getting 12 from 6*2, they mention ""plus 3"" which would be 12+3=15, then 15+7=22. But the code would need to model each of these steps.

Alternatively, the participant might have tried 7*3=21 first. Let's see:

curr_state = start_state
new_state = graph.explore_operation(
    curr_state,
    operation=""7*3=21"",
    resulting_state=(",qwen3-235b-a22b,,False,,False,,

Okay, let's see. The start state is [4,7,8,11], and the response given is (11-7)x4+8. The transcript says ""4 times 7 is 28, and 2 is 18, and 2 is 20."" Hmm, that transcript seems a bit confusing. Maybe there's a transcription error here.

First, the participant probably tried some operations. The response they submitted is (11-7)*4 +8. Let's break that down. 11-7 is 4, then multiplied by 4 gives 16, then adding 8 gives 24. So that's the correct path. But the transcript mentions ""4 times 7 is 28"", which would be 28, but then they mention ""and 2 is 18, and 2 is 20."" That part doesn't make sense. Maybe they meant something else. Maybe ""4 times 7 is 28, minus 8 is 20, plus 4 is 24""? But the transcript as given is unclear.

Wait, the participant's actual solution is (11-7)*4 +8. So first, they subtract 7 from 11 to get 4. Then multiply by 4 to get 16, then add 8 to get 24. So the steps are 11-7=4, then 4*4=16, then 16+8=24. But the transcript says ""4 times 7 is 28..."" which seems unrelated. Maybe the transcript is a mistake, or the participant made a mistake in their thinking.

Since the response is correct, the code should reflect the steps they took to get there. The transcript might have errors, so I need to rely on the response. Let's structure the code to show the correct operations. 

First, start with the initial state (4,7,8,11). Then perform 11-7=4, leading to state (4,4,8). Then multiply 4*4=16, leading to (8,16). Then add 8 to get 24. Wait, but the operation is (11-7)*4 +8. So combining the steps: subtract first, then multiply, then add. But each operation combines two numbers. So the first step is 11-7=4. Then take that result (4) and multiply by the existing 4, resulting in 16. Then add 8 to 16. 

So in the code, first explore_operation for 11-7=4. Then move_to_node to the new state (4,4,8). Then explore_operation 4*4=16. Then move_to_node to (8,16). Then explore_operation 16+8=24. 

But the transcript mentions ""4 times 7 is 28"", which is a different path. Maybe the participant tried that but then abandoned it. However, since the response is correct, perhaps the transcript is a red herring. The user instructions say to handle transcription errors by making reasonable assumptions. So I should code the correct steps even if the transcript seems off. 

Alternatively, maybe the transcript is a partial thought. Let me check again. The transcript says ""4 times 7 is 28, and 2 is 18, and 2 is 20."" That might be a mishearing or miswriting. Maybe the intended words were ""11 minus 7 is 4, then times 4 plus 8"". But the given transcript is as written. 

Since the response is correct, the code should reflect the steps in the response. So the code should model the operations as per the response formula. So the steps would be:

1. 11 - 7 = 4 → state (4,4,8)
2. 4 * 4 = 16 → state (8,16)
3. 16 + 8 = 24 → state (24,)

Therefore, the code should have these steps. The transcript's mention of ""4 times 7 is 28"" might be an error or a wrong path that wasn't part of the solution. Since the response is correct, the code should focus on the correct operations. 

So the Python code would start with the initial state, then perform the operations as per the solution. The transcript's mention might not be relevant here, and the user instructions allow for handling transcription errors by making assumptions. Therefore, the code should be written to reflect the correct steps leading to the response.

Okay, let's tackle this problem. The start state is [4,4,9,11], and the participant's response was ""9+11+4"", which sums to 24. But wait, 9+11 is 20, plus 4 is 24, but there's another 4 left. Oh right, the rules say all numbers must be used once. So their answer is actually incorrect because they only used three numbers. But the response time was 180 seconds, meaning they didn't submit a correct answer. Hmm.

Looking at the transcript, the participant tried several operations. First, they noted 9+11=20. Then considered 4/4=1 (but that's not helpful). Then tried 9-4=5, 5*4=20. Then 11-4=7, then 9*4=36-7=29. Then 9+4=13+11=24, but realized that uses only three numbers. Then tried 9+4+11-4=20. Then 11+4=15, etc. Also tried 4*4=16+11=27-9=18. Finally, they seem stuck.

So, the code needs to model their exploration. Let's start with the initial state. They first do 9+11=20, leading to (4,4,20). Then try adding 4, but that would be 20+4=24, leaving another 4 unused. The participant might have thought of 9+11+4=24 but realized there's an extra 4. So in the transcript, they mention ""9 plus 11 is 20... 9 plus 4 is 13 plus 11... 9 plus 4 plus 11 minus 4 is 20."" So they tried different combinations but didn't find the correct use of all numbers.

Wait, the correct solution for [4,4,9,11] is actually (11- (9/ (4/4))) ) = 11 - (9/1) = 2? No, that doesn't help. Alternatively, 4*(9 - (11-4)) = 4*(9-7)=8? Not 24. Maybe there's no solution, which is why the participant couldn't find one. But the response was ""9+11+4"", which is 24 but leaves out a 4. So the participant might have thought that answer, not realizing they need to use all numbers.

In the code, we need to model their steps. They start with 9+11=20, then try adding 4, but that leaves another 4. Then they backtrack. Also tried 4*4=16+11=27-9=18. Then 9*4=36-11=25. Then 11-4=7, etc. The code should show their various attempts, even if incorrect or incomplete. Also, since the response was incorrect, the graph should end without reaching 24.

So, the Python code would start with the initial state, then explore each operation step by step, including the incorrect ones, as per the transcript. Each operation they mention should be a node and edge in the graph. For example, 9+11=20 leading to (4,4,20), then trying 20+4=24 but leaving a 4, which isn't allowed. But since they didn't use all numbers, that's not a valid solution. The code should capture all these steps, even if they don't reach the goal.

Okay, let's tackle this problem. The start state is [9,10,10,13], and the response given was 13+10+10-9. The participant took 134 seconds, so they probably tried a few things before getting the answer.

First, looking at the transcript. The participant starts by mentioning the numbers and thinking about multiplying 10s and 9s. They tried 10*10=100 and 10*9=90, but those didn't help. Then they thought about dividing 10/10=1, but got confused. Later, they considered 13-10=3 and then 9*3=27, which also didn't work. Finally, they ended up with 13+10+10-9=24.

So, I need to map these steps into the GraphBuilder code. Let's break down each operation they mentioned.

First, the participant tried multiplying 10*10 and 10*9. So, operations like 10*10=100 and 10*9=90. Those would create new states. Then they thought about 10 divided by 10=1, which is another operation. 

Then, they tried 13-10=3, which is a subtraction. Then 9*3=27, which uses the 3 from the previous step. But that led to 27, which isn't 24. 

Later, they tried adding 13+10+10, which would be 33, then subtract 9 to get 24. That's the correct path. 

In the code, each of these steps should be represented as explore_operation calls. Also, when they backtrack or move between states, move_to_node is used. 

Wait, the correct answer is 13+10+10-9. Let's see: 13+10 is 23, plus another 10 is 33, minus 9 is 24. But how do they combine those numbers step by step? Each operation combines two numbers, so adding three numbers would require multiple steps. 

So first, maybe they added 13+10=23, resulting in state (10,9,23). Then added 23+10=33, leading to (9,33). Then subtracted 9: 33-9=24. Each of these steps is an operation.

So the code should have:

1. Explore 13+10=23, resulting in (10,9,23)
2. Move to that state, then add 23+10=33, resulting in (9,33)
3. Then subtract 9: 33-9=24.

But the participant might have thought of combining all in one step, but according to the rules, each operation combines two numbers. So the code needs to break it down into individual steps.

Looking back at the transcript, the participant says ""13 plus 10. 23, 33, minus 9."" So they added 13+10 first, then added another 10, then subtracted 9. Each step is a separate operation.

So the code should first do 13+10=23, then 23+10=33, then 33-9=24. Each of these is an explore_operation. 

Other attempts like multiplying 10s and 9s should also be included as other paths in the graph. For example, 10*10=100, 10*9=90, 10/10=1, 13-10=3, 9*3=27, etc. Each of these operations would be edges in the graph.

So putting it all together, the code would start with the initial state, then explore each of these operations as the participant mentioned them, moving between states as needed. The correct path would be the sequence leading to 24. 

I need to make sure that each operation uses numbers present in the current state. For example, when they do 10*10, both 10s are in the start state. Then the resulting state would have 100 and the remaining 9 and 13? Wait, no. Wait, each operation takes two numbers and combines them into one. So starting with (9,10,10,13), if they do 10*10, those two 10s are removed and replaced with 100. So the new state would be (9,13,100). Similarly for other operations.

So the code should have multiple explore_operation calls for each attempt, each creating a new state. Then, the correct path would be a sequence of operations leading from the start state to 24 via the additions and subtraction.

I need to structure the code to reflect the participant's thought process as they tried different operations, backtracked, and finally found the correct sequence.

Okay, let's tackle this problem. The start state is [2,2,9,11], and the response given is (9+2)+11+2. The participant's transcript mentions trying different combinations like 9-2, and then finally exclaiming ""9 plus 2, plus 11, plus 2!"" So I need to map their thought process into the graph structure.

First, the participant starts by considering 9 minus 2, which would be 7. But that doesn't lead to 24. Then they try adding 9 and 2, resulting in 11. Now the numbers are 11, 2, 11 (since one 2 is used, leaving another 2 and the original 11). Wait, no, original numbers are two 2s, 9, 11. If they do 9+2, that uses one 2, leaving 2, 11. Then adding 11 and the remaining 2: 11 + 11 + 2? Wait, no. Let me parse the response again.

The response is (9+2)+11+2. So breaking it down: 9+2=11, then 11+11=22, then 22+2=24. Wait, but that would require using both 2s and both 11s? Wait, original numbers are two 2s, 9, and 11. Wait, the start state is [2,2,9,11]. So adding 9+2 gives 11, then you have 11, 2, and 11. Then adding those together: 11 + 11 + 2 = 24. But each number must be used exactly once. Wait, that's a problem. Because the original numbers are two 2s, a 9, and an 11. The solution given uses 9+2 (using one 2), then adds 11 and the remaining 2. Wait, but that would be (9+2) =11, then 11 (from the original) + remaining 2. Wait, that's 11 + 11 + 2? No, that doesn't make sense. Or maybe the operations are (9+2) =11, then 11 +11 =22, then 22 +2=24. But that would use both 11 and the two 2s. Wait, but the original 11 is there, and after using 9+2, you have 11 (the result), the original 11, and the remaining 2. Hmm, that seems like a mistake. Wait, maybe the participant is combining numbers differently. Let me check the response again: (9+2)+11+2. So that's 11 +11 +2? That's 24? No, 11+11 is 22 plus 2 is 24. But that uses 9, one 2, 11, and another 2. So all four numbers. So the steps are: 9+2=11, then add 11 and 2. But how do they combine those numbers? Because after 9+2, you have 11, 2, and 11. Then adding all together: 11 + 11 + 2 =24. But that's three numbers left. Wait, maybe the operations are done step by step. First, 9+2=11, then 11+11=22, then 22+2=24. Each operation reduces the count of numbers. Let's see:

Start with 2,2,9,11.

First operation: 9+2=11. Now the numbers are 2,11,11 (since 9 and one 2 are used, replaced by 11).

Second operation: 11+11=22. Now numbers are 2 and 22.

Third operation: 22+2=24. Which gives the result. But each number must be used exactly once. Wait, but in this case, the original 9 and one 2 are used in the first step, then the resulting 11 and the original 11, then the remaining 2. So all four numbers are used. So the steps are valid.

So the participant's thought process starts with trying 9-2 which gives 7, but that's not helpful. Then they try adding 9+2, leading to 11, then adding the rest. So in the graph, we need to represent the steps they tried, including the incorrect ones.

In the transcript, the participant says: ""9 minus 2, 8, 9, no, 8, 13, no, 4, 11, 9, plus 2, plus 11, plus 2!"" So they tried several incorrect paths before hitting on the solution.

So first, the participant explores 9-2=7. Then maybe other operations leading to dead ends. Then finally, they do 9+2=11, then add 11 and 2.

So in the code:

Start with the initial state (2,2,9,11).

First, explore_operation for 9-2=7, resulting in (2,7,11).

Then, maybe other operations that don't lead to the solution.

But the transcript mentions several incorrect attempts like 8, 13, etc., which might be miscalculations. However, the participant eventually arrives at the correct solution.

The final correct steps are:

1. 9+2=11 → new state (2,11,11)
2. 11+11=22 → new state (2,22)
3. 22+2=24 → (24,)

So in the code, we need to model these steps. Also, the participant's transcript includes backtracking and incorrect attempts, which should be represented as explore_operation calls with result_calc_error=True where applicable.

But the response time is 82 seconds, so they had time to explore several paths. The transcript shows they tried 9-2 first, then other things, then the correct path.

So the code should first explore 9-2=7, then other incorrect operations, then move back to the start state and try the correct path.

Wait, but the response given is (9+2)+11+2. So the participant must have found that path. So in the code:

After starting, they try 9-2=7 (incorrect path), then other operations, then go back and try 9+2=11.

So the code steps:

start_state = (2,2,9,11)

curr_state = start_state

First, explore_operation for 9-2=7, resulting in (2,7,11). Then, perhaps other operations from that state.

But the transcript also mentions ""8, 9, no, 8, 13, no, 4, 11..."" which might be miscalculations or other attempts. For example, maybe trying 2*4=8, but where does 4 come from? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe 11- (something). But the transcript is a bit unclear.

Eventually, the participant says ""9 plus 2, plus 11, plus 2!"" which indicates the correct steps.

So in the code:

After the initial attempt of 9-2=7, the participant might have tried other operations from the start state.

Then, they try 9+2=11, then from the new state (2,11,11), they add 11+11=22, then 22+2=24.

Each of these steps needs to be represented with explore_operation, and move_to_node when moving between states.

So the code would look like:

start_state = (2,2,9,11)
curr_state = start_state
graph = GraphBuilder(curr_state)

new_state1 = graph.explore_operation(

)

# Then, maybe other operations from the start state, like trying 2+2=4, etc., but transcript isn't clear. Alternatively, the participant might have tried adding 9+2.

# Then, the participant moves back to start state and tries 9+2=11

Okay, let's see. The participant is given the numbers 4, 4, 5, 10 and needs to make 24. They responded with (10-5)x4+4. Let me break down their thought process.

First, they tried 4x4=16, but that didn't help. Then 5x4=20 plus 4 is 24, but they mention what to do with the 10. So maybe they realized that approach doesn't use all numbers. Then they tried various additions like 4+4=8, adding 10 to get 18, not enough. Then they had the idea: 10-5=5, then multiply by 4 to get 20, add the last 4 to reach 24. That uses all numbers: 10,5,4,4. 

In the graph, they start at (4,4,5,10). First, they explore operations but make some mistakes. Then they set on the correct path: subtracting 5 from 10 to get 5, multiplying that 5 by 4 to get 20, then adding the remaining 4. Each step should be a node. The final operation is combining those steps into (10-5)*4 +4. 

I need to represent each operation step. So first, subtract 5 from 10: 10-5=5, leading to state (4,4,5). Then multiply 5 by 4: 5*4=20, new state (4,20). Then add 4 to 20: 20+4=24. Each of these steps should be edges in the graph. Also, check if they backtracked or set subgoals. The transcript shows they tried several things before hitting on the correct path. So the code should create nodes for each intermediate state and connect them with the operations.

Okay, let's see. The start state is [1,5,9,10], and the response is (10+9+5)x1. The participant solved it in 18 seconds. The transcript says they added 10+9+5 to get 24 and then multiplied by 1. Wait, but 10+9+5 is actually 24, right? 10+9 is 19 plus 5 is 24. Then multiplying by 1 doesn't change it. So the steps are straightforward.

First, the participant probably set a subgoal of getting 24. Then they added 10,9,5. But wait, adding three numbers. How does that work in the graph? Each operation combines two numbers. So adding 10+9 first to get 19, then adding 5 to get 24. Then multiply by 1. But the transcript mentions multiplying by 1 at the end. So the steps would be:

1. 10 + 9 = 19, resulting in [1,5,19]
2. 19 +5 =24, resulting in [1,24]
3. 24 *1 =24, resulting in [24]

But the response is (10+9+5)*1, which implies all three added first. But according to the rules, each operation combines two numbers. So the participant would have to do two additions first. But in the transcript, they mention adding all three, but the code needs to break it into steps.

Wait, the code's explore_operation function can handle multi-step operations by splitting them into sub-operations. For example, if the participant says ""10+9+5"", the code would split that into 10+9=19, then 19+5=24. So in the graph, there should be two nodes: one after adding 10+9, then adding that result with 5. Then multiply by 1.

But the transcript says ""10 plus 9 is 19 plus 5 is 24"". So first, 10+9=19. Then 19+5=24. Then multiply by 1. So each step is an operation.

So the code should first explore 10+9=19, then explore 19+5=24, then move to that state and explore 24*1=24. But wait, the 1 is part of the initial numbers. So after adding 10+9+5, the remaining number is 1. Then combining 24 and 1 via multiplication.

Wait, but the response is (10+9+5)*1. So the participant added all three numbers and multiplied by 1. But according to the game rules, each operation uses two numbers. So the code needs to represent each step as combining two numbers. So first, 10+9=19, then 19+5=24, then 24*1=24. Each of these steps would be separate operations in the graph.

So the code would have:

- Start state (1,5,9,10)
- Explore operation 10+9=19 → new state (1,5,19)
- Then explore 19+5=24 → new state (1,24)
- Then move to (1,24) and explore 24*1=24 → resulting in (24)

Each of these steps would be separate explore_operation calls.

But the transcript mentions ""times 1"" at the end, so the participant is aware that multiplying by 1 is necessary. So the code should capture all these steps.

So the code would start with the initial state, then perform the first addition, then the second, then the multiplication. Each step would be a node in the graph. Also, the participant might have set a subgoal of (24,1) before doing the multiplication, but according to the transcript, it's straightforward.

I need to make sure that each operation is valid with the current state. For example, adding 10+9 requires that both 10 and 9 are present in the current state. Then adding 19+5 requires 19 and 5 to be present. Then multiplying 24 and 1.

So the code would look like:

start_state = (1,5,9,10)
graph = GraphBuilder(start_state)
curr_state = start_state

# First operation: 10 +9 =19
new_state1 = graph.explore_operation(curr_state, ""10+9=19"", (1,5,19), comment=""10 plus 9 is 19"")

# Move to new_state1
curr_state = graph.move_to_node(new_state1)

# Second operation: 19 +5 =24
new_state2 = graph.explore_operation(curr_state, ""19+5=24"", (1,24), comment=""19 plus 5 is 24"")

# Move to new_state2
curr_state = graph.move_to_node(new_state2)

# Third operation: 24 *1 =24
new_state3 = graph.explore_operation(curr_state, ""24*1=24"", (24,), comment=""24 multiplied by 1 is 24"")

That should represent the participant's steps accurately. Each operation is a step in the process. The response is (10+9+5)x1, which is equivalent to ((10+9)+5)*1. So the code captures that.

Okay, let's tackle this problem. The start state is [7,12,12,13], and the participant didn't submit a response, so they probably couldn't find a solution. The transcript shows they tried various operations but kept getting close numbers like 29, 28, 26, but not 24.

First, I need to map their thought process into the GraphBuilder code. Let's start by looking at their initial attempts. They mentioned ""12 minus 7 is 5,"" which doesn't work. Then they tried multiplication and division but struggled with big numbers. 

The participant tried 12-7=5, which results in a state with 5, 12, 13. Then they might have tried combining other numbers. They mentioned getting 29, which could be 12+12+ (something like 5, but 12+12+5=29). Maybe they added 12+12+ (13-7- something?), but that's unclear. 

They also mentioned trying to group numbers for both multiplication and division. For example, maybe they tried (13-7)=6, then 6* something. But 6*4=24, and how to get 4 from 12 and 12? 12/3=4, but there's no 3 here. Wait, the numbers are 7,12,12,13. 

Another possible path: 13- (12/12) = 12. Then 12* (something like 2, but 7 is left). Not helpful. 

Alternatively, 12* (something). If they multiply 12* (something), maybe 12*(13 - (12/ something)), but 7 is tricky. 

The participant also mentioned trying to get 24 through combinations that result in decimals, which might not be valid since all operations must result in integers. 

In the transcript, they say they tried multiplication, division, grouping, but couldn't hit 24. So the code should reflect their attempts, even if they didn't reach the solution. 

So, in the code, I need to create nodes for each operation they tried, even if incorrect. For example, 12-7=5, then trying to use 5 with other numbers. Also, attempts like adding 12+12+ (something) leading to 29. 

They also mentioned trying to get 5 through 12-7, then maybe multiplying by another number. But since 5* something isn't leading to 24 with the remaining numbers. 

Another part: ""7 and 5. We come up with a decimal, so that doesn't work. And I take care of there. That comes up with 29."" Maybe they tried 13 + 12 + (12/7?), but that's a decimal. 

The code should include these incorrect steps, marking result_calc_error where applicable. Also, backtracking when they realize a path isn't working. 

So, steps in code:

1. Start state (7,12,12,13)
2. Explore 12-7=5, resulting in (5,12,13)
3. Try adding those: 5+12+13=30, which is not helpful.
4. Maybe try multiplying 12-7=5 then 5* something. But remaining numbers are 12 and 13. 5*12=60, then 60-13=47, not 24.
5. Try another approach: 13-12=1, then 12-7=5, but not helpful.
6. Try multiplying 12* (something). 12*2=24, but how to get 2? Maybe 13- (12+ something). Wait, 13-7=6, then 12-6=6? Not sure.
7. They mentioned getting 29, which could be 12+12+5 (from 12-7=5). So 12+12+5=29. So that's an operation leading to (29,13), but that's not correct.
8. Also tried (13-7)=6, then 6*4=24, but how to get 4 from 12 and 12? 12/3=4, but no 3. Alternatively, 12- (something). Maybe 12/ (12/ something) but not possible here.
9. The participant might have tried (12* (13- (something))), but couldn't find the right combination.

Each of these attempts should be represented as explore_operation calls, even if they result in errors. Also, when they backtrack, use move_to_node to return to previous states.

So, the code would start with the initial state, then explore each operation step, adding nodes and edges as they try different calculations, even if incorrect. The comments should reference the transcript quotes.

Okay, let's see. The participant is working on the problem with numbers 2, 3, 7, 9. They need to make 24. The response they submitted is ((9+7)/2)x3. So I need to map their transcript into the steps that lead to that solution.

First, looking at the transcript. They start by listing some combinations: 7+3=10, 9x2=18, 2x3=6, etc. But none of these work. Then they mention 9+7=16. That's a key step. So they added 9 and 7 to get 16. Then they say ""16 divided by 2 times 3."" That's the path to the solution. 

So the steps would be: first, add 9 and 7 to get 16. Then divide that by 2, resulting in 8. Then multiply by 3 to get 24. 

Wait, but the response is ((9+7)/2)x3. So the operations are combining 9 and 7 first, then dividing by 2, then multiplying by 3. 

In the graph, each operation should be a step. So first, the participant adds 9 and 7. That would be an explore_operation step, taking the start state (2,3,7,9), using 9+7 to make 16, resulting in the state (2,3,16). Then, they divide 16 by 2, which would take that state to (3,8), since 16/2=8. Then multiply 8 and 3 to get 24. 

I need to make sure each operation is correctly represented. Also, the comments should reflect the participant's transcript. 

So the first explore_operation is adding 9 and 7. The resulting state is (2,3,16). Then moving to that state, divide by 2, which would be 16/2=8. Resulting state (3,8). Then move to that state and multiply 3*8=24. 

Wait, but the participant's response is ((9+7)/2)*3. So the order is (16/2) *3. So after getting 16, divide by 2 to get 8, then multiply by 3. 

So each of these steps should be individual operations in the graph. 

Let me check the code structure. The explore_operation function takes the current state, the operation as a string, and the resulting state. 

First step: curr_state is (2,3,7,9). Operation is 9+7=16. Resulting state (2,3,16). 

Second step: curr_state (2,3,16). Operation is 16/2=8. Resulting state (3,8). 

Third step: curr_state (3,8). Operation is 3*8=24. Resulting state (24,). 

Each of these steps needs to be added with explore_operation, and move_to_node as necessary. 

Also, the participant might have backtracked or tried other paths, but according to the transcript, they found 9+7=16, then divided by 2 and multiplied by 3. 

So the code should first create the graph with the start state. Then perform the first explore_operation on 9+7=16. Then move_to_node to (2,3,16), then explore_operation dividing by 2. Then move_to_node to (3,8), then explore_operation multiplying to 24. 

I need to make sure that each operation is correctly formatted as a string, like ""9+7=16"", ""16/2=8"", ""3*8=24"". Also, check if any calculation errors, but in this case, all steps are correct. 

So putting it all together in code:

Initialize graph with start_state (2,3,7,9). 

First explore_operation: curr_state is start_state, operation ""9+7=16"", resulting_state (2,3,16). 

Then move_to_node to new_state. 

Second explore_operation: operation ""16/2=8"", resulting_state (3,8). 

Move_to_node again, then third explore_operation ""3*8=24"". 

That should build the graph correctly. Also, the comments should reference the transcript parts where they mention each step. For example, ""9 plus 7 is 16"" and ""16 divided by 2 times 3"".

Okay, let's see. The user provided a start state of [9,11,12,13], and the participant's response was ""13-9"", which is incomplete. The response time was 180 seconds, meaning they didn't solve it. The transcript shows they tried several approaches.

First, the participant mentions ""13 minus 9, 4"", so they calculated 13-9=4. Then they tried to use that 4 somehow. They also thought about 9 minus 11, which is -2, but that's probably not helpful. Then they considered multiplying that -2 by 12 to get -24, but that leaves 13 unused. They also tried 12 divided by 9 and vice versa, which didn't work.

The main path seems to be starting with 13-9=4. Then they might have tried combining that 4 with other numbers. Wait, the participant said ""4 times, oh my god..."" but didn't finish. Maybe they tried 4 times something but couldn't find the right combination. They also mentioned 24, so they were aiming for that.

In the code, I need to represent each operation they tried. So first, the 13-9=4 operation, leading to state (4, 11, 12). Then, maybe they tried multiplying 4 by something. But in the transcript, they don't mention that. Instead, they tried other things like 9-11. Also, they mentioned ""12 divided by 9"", which would be 1.333, but that's not helpful. 

The participant also backtracked a lot, so using move_to_node to return to previous states. They set a subgoal maybe when they mentioned trying to get 4 first. Also, there's a calculation error if they thought 4 times something gives 24 but miscalculated.

I need to map each part of the transcript to code. For example, ""13 minus 9"" becomes an explore_operation with 13-9=4. Then, the attempt to use that 4 in another operation, but since they didn't find it, maybe no further steps. Also, other attempts like 9-11, 12/9, etc., should be added as separate operations.

Also, note that the participant's final response was ""13-9"", which is incomplete, so the code should show that they didn't reach 24. The graph should include all the explored operations but not a path to 24.

Okay, let's tackle this problem. The start state is [5,7,13,13], and the participant's response was 13-(7(13+5)), which equals 13 - (7*18) = 13 - 126 = -113, which is not 24. So the response is incorrect. The transcript shows confusion and multiple attempts.

First, the participant says ""13 minus 5... 7."" Maybe they tried 13-5=8, but then mentions 7. Maybe a miscalculation. Then they correct to 13-5=8. But how does 7 come into play? Maybe they tried combining 7 with the result.

Next, they mention ""13 minus seven"" and ""13 plus 5 would make 18"", leading to 7*18=126. Then 13-126=-113. The participant realizes this isn't right. They backtrack multiple times, indicating confusion.

In the code, I need to represent each operation step. The participant tried 13-5=8, then 13+5=18. Then multiplied by 7 (maybe 7*18=126), then subtracted from 13. Each of these steps should be explore_operation calls. Also, since the final result is incorrect, result_calc_error should be True where applicable.

I should also check if the participant set any subgoals. They mentioned working backward, like trying to get a certain number to subtract or multiply. But the transcript doesn't clearly state a subgoal, so maybe skip set_subgoal here.

So steps:

1. 13-5=8 (correct)
2. Then maybe adding 8+ something? Or moving on.
3. Trying 13+5=18 (correct)
4. Multiplying 7*18=126 (correct math, but participant might have intended this)
5. Then 13-126=-113 (incorrect for 24)
6. Backtracking and trying again.

Each of these operations should be added as explore_operation with appropriate comments. Also, handle the incorrect final result by setting result_calc_error=True where needed.

Need to structure the code to move between states as the participant backtracks. For example, after trying 13-5=8, they might go back to the start state to try another approach.

Also, note that there are two 13s. When combining numbers, need to ensure that the correct instances are used. For example, using one 13 for subtraction and another for addition, but the code should handle duplicates by considering the tuple sorted.

So, the code would start with the start_state, then each operation step as per the transcript, using move_to_node when backtracking.

Okay, let's see. The start state is [1,3,3,7], and the response is 7x3+3x1. The transcript says the participant thought 7*3 is 21, then added 3*1. So they combined two multiplications and summed them.

First, I need to model how the participant arrived at this solution. They probably started by considering each operation step-by-step. Let me break down the steps.

The participant mentions 7 times 3, which uses two of the numbers. But there are two 3s here. So first, they might have multiplied 7 and 3. Let's check: using one 3, leaving another 3 and 1. 

So first operation: 7*3=21. Resulting state would be (1,3,21). Then, they do 3*1=3, using the remaining numbers. Resulting state would be (21,3). Then adding those together: 21+3=24. 

Wait, but in the code, each operation combines two numbers into one. So each step reduces the count of numbers by one. So the participant first does 7*3=21, then 3*1=3, then adds them. But how to represent each step in the graph.

So first, from the start state (1,3,3,7), multiply 7 and 3. That gives (1,3,21). Then, in that new state, multiply 3 and 1 to get 3, resulting in (21,3). Then, add those two to get 24.

But the code's explore_operation function requires each operation to be a single step. So each multiplication and addition is a separate step. So the code should have three operations: first 7*3=21, then 3*1=3, then 21+3=24.

Wait, but the participant's response is written as 7x3+3x1, which is (7*3)+(3*1). So they might have considered both multiplications as part of the same step, but in the graph, each operation is a single step. So the code needs to model each operation step by step.

Therefore, the steps would be:

1. Multiply 7 and 3 → 21, resulting in state (1,3,21)
2. Multiply 3 and 1 → 3, resulting in state (21,3)
3. Add 21 and 3 → 24.

Each of these steps would be an explore_operation call. Also, after each operation, the current state changes, so after the first operation, we need to move_to_node the new state before performing the next operation.

Wait, but in the code example for the previous case where the response was (3x4)x(10-8), the participant first did 3*4=12, then moved to that node, then did 10-8=2, then multiplied 12*2=24. So each operation is a separate step, requiring move_to_node in between.

So applying that here:

First, start_state = (1,3,3,7). 

First operation: 7*3=21. So explore_operation with curr_state as start_state, operation ""7*3=21"", resulting_state (1,3,21). Then move_to_node to (1,3,21).

Second operation: 3*1=3. So explore_operation on curr_state (1,3,21), operation ""3*1=3"", resulting_state (21,3). Then move_to_node to (21,3).

Third operation: 21+3=24. Explore_operation to get to (24,).

But the participant's transcript says ""7 times 3 plus 3 times 1"". So maybe they combined the two multiplications and the addition in one step, but according to the rules, each operation must be a single step. So the code must break it into individual steps.

But the response is written as 7x3+3x1, which is two multiplications and an addition. So the code should model each operation step by step.

So the code would be:

start_state = (1,3,3,7)
curr_state = start_state
graph = GraphBuilder(curr_state)

# First, multiply 7 and 3
new_state1 = graph.explore_operation(
    curr_state,
    operation=""7*3=21"",
    resulting_state=(1,3,21),
    comment=""Participant multiplies 7 and 3"",
)

# Move to the new state (1,3,21)
curr_state = graph.move_to_node(new_state1)

# Then multiply 3 and 1
new_state2 = graph.explore_operation(
    curr_state,
    operation=""3*1=3"",
    resulting_state=(21,3),
    comment=""Participant multiplies 3 and 1"",
)

# Move to the new state (21,3)
curr_state = graph.move_to_node(new_state2)

# Then add them together
new_state3 = graph.explore_operation(
    curr_state,
    operation=""21+3=24"",
    resulting_state=(24,),
    comment=""Participant adds the results to get 24"",
)

But wait, the participant's transcript says ""7 times 3 plus 3 times 1"". So they might have considered both multiplications and the addition in one step, but according to the code's structure, each operation is a separate step. The code must reflect each individual operation.

Also, the response is 7x3+3x1, which is equivalent to (7*3)+(3*1) = 21 +3 =24. So the code needs to model each multiplication and then the addition.

Therefore, the code should have these three steps as above. Each operation is a separate explore_operation call, moving through the states.

I need to make sure that the resulting states are correctly sorted. For example, (1,3,21) should be sorted as (1,3,21), and (21,3) becomes (3,21) when sorted. Wait, no: in the code, the states are tuples of integers, and they are sorted when stored. So when creating new_state1, the resulting_state should be sorted. The original numbers are 1,3,3,7. After multiplying 7 and 3 (assuming one of the 3s), the remaining numbers are 1, 3, and 21. So sorted, that's (1,3,21). Then multiplying 3 and 1 gives 3, so remaining numbers are 21 and 3, sorted as (3,21). Then adding them gives 24.

So the code should have:

First explore_operation from (1,3,3,7) to (1,3,21) via 7*3=21.

Then from (1,3,21), multiply 3*1=3, leading to (3,21).

Then add 3+21=24.

So the code would be as follows.

start_state = (1, 3, 3, 7)

Okay, let's tackle this problem. The start state is [6,6,8,9], and the response given is (8-6)x9+6. The transcript is a bit short: ""minus 6 bracket closed plus 9 plus 6 times 9 plus 6"". Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Let me parse through this step by step.

First, the participant probably started by considering the numbers 6, 6, 8, 9. They need to use each exactly once. The correct answer is (8-6)*9 +6 = 2*9 +6 = 18+6=24. But how did they get there based on the transcript?

The transcript mentions ""minus 6 bracket closed plus 9 plus 6 times 9 plus 6"". This seems fragmented. Maybe they started with 8-6, which is 2. Then maybe multiplied by 9, getting 18, then added 6 to reach 24. But the way it's phrased is a bit unclear. Let's break down possible steps.

First operation: 8-6=2. Resulting state would be (6,9,2). Then multiply by 9: 2*9=18, leading to (6,18). Then add 6: 18+6=24. Each of these steps needs to be represented in the graph.

But the transcript mentions ""plus 9 plus 6 times 9 plus 6"", which might be a bit jumbled. The participant might have mentioned the operations out of order. The key is to map each operation they mention into the steps, even if the transcript is a bit messy.

So, first, the participant likely tried 8-6=2. Then multiplied that result by 9, then added the remaining 6. Each of these operations should be nodes in the graph. Also, the code needs to use the GraphBuilder methods correctly, using explore_operation for each step and move_to_node when moving between states.

Wait, but the transcript is very short. The participant might have only mentioned parts of the process. The response they submitted is (8-6)x9+6, so the steps they took should align with that. Let's structure the code accordingly.

First, start with the initial state. Then perform 8-6=2. Then multiply that result (2) by 9, but wait, after getting 2 from 8-6, the remaining numbers are 6 and 9. Wait, no: original state is [6,6,8,9]. When you do 8-6=2, you use 8 and one 6, leaving 6 and 9. So the resulting state after first operation is (6,9,2). Then, multiply 2 and 9 to get 18, using 2 and 9, leaving 6. Resulting state is (6,18). Then add 6 and 18 to get 24. But each operation must combine two numbers each time.

So the steps are:

1. 8-6=2 → state becomes (6,9,2)
2. 2*9=18 → state becomes (6,18)
3. 6+18=24 → state becomes (24,)

But the transcript only mentions parts of this. The participant's transcript says ""minus 6 bracket closed plus 9 plus 6 times 9 plus 6"". Maybe they mentioned the operations in a different order. Let's see:

""minus 6"" could be part of (8-6). Then ""bracket closed"" suggests parentheses. Then ""plus 9 plus 6 times 9 plus 6"" – maybe they're trying to structure the equation as (8-6)*9 +6. The transcript might have been cut off or misheard.

In the code, each operation step needs to be captured. So first, the subtraction, then multiplication, then addition. Each step would be an explore_operation call. Since the participant submitted the correct answer, the code should reflect those steps even if the transcript is a bit unclear.

So the Python code would start with the initial state, perform 8-6=2, then multiply the result by 9, then add 6. Each of these steps would be added via explore_operation, and move_to_node when moving to the new state after each operation.

I need to make sure that the resulting states are correctly calculated. Also, check that each operation uses numbers from the current state. Let's structure the code accordingly.

Okay, let's see. The user provided a transcript where the participant tried various operations but couldn't find a solution. The start state is [1,3,3,10], and the response was blank after 180 seconds.

First, I need to parse the transcript and map each step to the graph operations. The participant starts by listing the numbers and then tries different combinations. Each time they attempt an operation, I should use explore_operation. If they backtrack, move_to_node is needed.

Looking at the transcript:

1. ""10 times, no, 10 plus 3..."" They try 10+3=13, but that's not helpful. Then 3*3=9, adding 10 gives 19. Then 10*3=30, subtract 4 (but where's 4 from? Maybe a mistake here). They mention 30-3-1=26. Then 10-1=9, 9+9=18. Then 3+1=4, 4*3=12 +10=22. Also tries 3+3=6, etc. All these attempts don't reach 24.

Each of these operations should be added as nodes and edges. For example, when they do 3*3=9, that's an operation leading to a new state (1,9,10). Then adding 10 would be another step. But since they mention ""no"" after some steps, maybe those are incorrect operations.

Also, when they say ""There is no answer to this one,"" it indicates they gave up. But the code should still represent all their attempts.

Need to make sure each operation is correctly parsed. For example, ""10 times 3 is 30. 30 minus 4, 30 minus 4 is 26"" – but where does 4 come from? Maybe a miscalculation, so the operation would be 10*3=30, then 30-4, but since 4 isn't in the state, maybe the participant made a mistake. So the code should reflect the operations as stated, even if incorrect.

Also, when they mention ""3 times 3 is 9. No. 10 times 3 is 30. 30 minus 3 is 27, minus 1 is 26."" So each of these steps should be separate operations.

Need to track each move: after each operation, if they backtrack, use move_to_node to return to a previous state.

The final code should build the graph with all these attempts, even though they didn't reach a solution. The response is blank, so the graph ends without reaching (24,).

Okay, let's see. The start state is [1,4,7,13], and the response given is (4/1)+7+13. The transcript mentions that the participant added 13+7+4 to get 24 but needed to use the 1. So they did 4 divided by 1, which is 4, then added 7 and 13.

First, I need to model the participant's thought process. They start by recognizing that 13 +7 is 20, and adding 4 makes 24. But since they have to use all numbers, including the 1, they adjust by using division. 

The first step in the code should be setting a subgoal. The participant mentions working towards 24 by combining 4,7,13. Maybe they thought of 4+7+13 but that's 24 already, but they included the 1 by doing 4/1. So perhaps the subgoal is (4/1), 7, 13. 

Wait, the code example from previous answers uses set_subgoal when the participant is working backward. For instance, when they mention 6*4=24, they set a subgoal. Here, the participant might be working forward. 

The transcript says ""4 divided by 1 is 4"", so they first compute that. Then add 7 and 13. So the operations would be 4/1=4, then 4+7=11, then 11+13=24. But in the response, it's all in one step. However, according to the code guidelines, each operation should combine numbers from the current state. 

Wait, the initial state is (1,4,7,13). The participant does 4/1=4, which uses 4 and 1, resulting in (4,7,13). Then they add those three numbers. So first operation: 4/1=4, then 4+7+13=24. But in the code, each explore_operation should represent a single step. So the first step is 4/1=4, leading to state (4,7,13). Then the next step is adding all three: 4+7+13=24. 

But according to the code's explore_operation method, each operation should replace numbers in the current state. So for the first operation, in the start state (1,4,7,13), using 1 and 4 to make 4 (from 4/1=4), resulting in state (4,7,13). Then, in that new state, adding all three numbers (4+7+13=24) would be another operation. 

So the code should first call explore_operation for 4/1=4, then move_to_node to the new state (4,7,13), then explore_operation for 4+7+13=24. 

But the response is written as a single expression: (4/1)+7+13. However, in the game, each operation combines two numbers at a time. So the participant might have done 4/1 first, then added 7, then added 13. But each addition is a separate step. However, the code's explore_operation allows for combining multiple numbers in a single operation if it's a valid step. Wait, no. According to the code's guidelines, each operation must replace numbers in the current state. For example, adding 4,7,13 all at once would require that they are in the state and the operation uses them. But in the state (4,7,13), you can't add all three in one step unless the operation is 4+7+13. However, the code's get_sub_operations function might split this into multiple steps. 

Wait, the code's explore_operation function allows for operations that have multiple sub-operations. For example, if the operation is ""4+7+13=24"", the sub_operations would be adding two numbers at a time. But according to the code's example, if the participant says ""add all three"", the code would need to break it down. However, in the example where the participant says ""12+8+10=30"", the code uses a single operation. So perhaps in such cases, the code can accept multi-number operations as a single step, even though technically they require multiple operations. 

But according to the game rules, each operation combines two numbers. So the participant's actual steps would be: 4/1=4 (using 4 and 1), then 4+7=11 (using 4 and 7), then 11+13=24. So three steps. However, the participant's transcript says ""4 divided by 1 is 4, and then we'll just add 7 and we'll add 13."" So they might have done two steps: 4/1=4, then 4+7+13. But adding three numbers in one step isn't allowed unless it's a series of operations. 

But in the code examples provided earlier, for instance, when the participant says ""sixteen plus six is twenty-four"" in the first example, it's treated as a single operation even though 16+6 uses two numbers. Similarly, in the case of adding three numbers, maybe the code allows it if the participant states it as a single operation. 

In the transcript, the participant says: ""we'll just add 7 and we'll add 13."" So they might be adding 4+7 first, then adding 13. But the code might need to represent each binary operation. However, the code's explore_operation function can handle multiple sub-operations. 

Alternatively, the code might allow combining multiple numbers if the participant implies it. For example, if the participant says ""add all three"", then the code can represent it as a single operation. 

But according to the code's guidelines, the operation must replace numbers in the current state with the result. So in the first step, after 4/1=4, the state is (4,7,13). Then, adding 4+7=11, leading to (11,13), then 11+13=24. However, the participant's response is written as a single expression: (4/1)+7+13. So perhaps the code should model this as two steps: first 4/1=4, then adding 4+7+13. But how to represent the second step. 

Alternatively, the code can model the entire expression as a single operation, even though it's technically multiple steps, because the participant's final answer is a single expression. However, the code's example where the participant says ""sixteen plus six is twenty-four"" and it's treated as a single operation, even though it's a miscalculation. 

In this case, the participant's final answer is (4/1)+7+13. So the code should model the steps they took. The transcript says: ""4 divided by 1 is 4. So let's say 4 divided by 1, which is 4, and then we'll just add 7 and we'll add 13."" So they first do 4/1, then add 7, then add 13. But in the code, each of these would be separate operations. 

But given the code's structure, perhaps the code can model the first operation (4/1=4) and then the resulting state (4,7,13), then the next operation as adding all three numbers in one step. Even though in reality it's two additions, but the participant might have done it in one step mentally. 

Alternatively, the code should split it into two steps. However, the code's example for the first user input had a similar case where the participant added three numbers in one step. For example, in the first example, the participant said ""12+8+10=30"" and it was treated as a single operation. So perhaps in this case, the code can model the addition of 4+7+13 as a single operation. 

So the steps would be:

1. Start state (1,4,7,13)
2. Explore operation 4/1=4, resulting in (4,7,13)
3. Move to new state (4,7,13)
4. Explore operation 4+7+13=24, resulting in (24,)

But according to the game rules, each operation must combine two numbers. So adding three numbers in one step isn't allowed. Therefore, the code should model each binary operation. However, the code's example allows for multiple numbers to be combined in one operation if the participant states it that way. 

Wait, looking back at the code's guidelines for explore_operation:

""Operation Rules:
Every operation replaces numbers in the current state with a new number. The numbers on the left side of the equation MUST BE PRESENT in the current state for an operation to be explored.""

So, for an operation like ""4+7+13=24"", the current state must have 4,7,13. The operation would replace all three numbers with 24. But according to the game rules, each operation can only combine two numbers at a time. Therefore, this would not be a valid step. 

Therefore, the code should model each binary operation step. So after 4/1=",qwen3-235b-a22b,,False,,False,,

Okay, let's tackle this problem. The start state is [3,5,12,12], and the participant's response was (12-3)+(5+12). But they took 180 seconds, so they probably struggled a bit. Let me look at the transcript.

First, the participant mentions 12 plus 12 is 24. That's an obvious path, but they might have realized that leaves out 3 and 5. So they tried other operations. They said dividing 12 by 3 to get 4. Let me check: 12/3=4. Then they considered 12-3=9. Then 9+12=21. But how do they get to 24 from there? Maybe adding 5? 21+5=26, which is over. Hmm.

Wait, the response they submitted was (12-3)+(5+12). Let's compute that: 12-3=9, 5+12=17, 9+17=26. Wait, that's 26, not 24. Oh, that's a problem. So their answer is incorrect. But the transcript might show their thought process. 

In the transcript, after trying 12-3=9 and adding 12 to get 21, they mention 12-5. Maybe they tried 12-5=7, then 7+ something. But the transcript seems a bit jumbled. They also mentioned ""bracket 12. 12, you can take 12."" Maybe they were trying different combinations.

So, the graph should represent their attempts. Let's start with the initial state (3,5,12,12). First, they tried 12+12=24, but that leaves 3 and 5 unused. So that's an explore_operation leading to (24,3,5). Then they realized that's not valid, so they backtrack.

Next, they tried 12/3=4. So operation 12/3=4, resulting in (4,5,12). Then maybe they tried adding those numbers. But in the transcript, they also tried 12-3=9, leading to (5,9,12). Then 9+12=21, leading to (5,21). Then adding 5+21=26. But that's not 24. 

They also mentioned 12-5, which would be 7, leading to (3,7,12). Then maybe combining 7 and 12 again? Or adding 3. But the transcript is unclear. 

The participant's final answer was incorrect, so the graph should show their attempts, including the wrong path. Also, they might have set a subgoal of reaching 24 through addition, hence the (12-3)+(5+12), even though it sums to 26. 

I need to map each operation they mentioned into the graph. For example, ""12 divided by 3 is 4"" becomes an operation, ""12 minus 3 is 9"" another, then adding 9 and 12. Also, their confusion with 12 minus 5 and other combinations. 

I should also note when they backtracked or moved between states. The code should use explore_operation for each calculation they mention, move_to_node when they go back to previous states, and set_subgoal if they mention a target. 

Wait, the participant didn't explicitly set a subgoal, but their approach was trying to combine parts. So maybe no subgoal setting here. 

Each step in the transcript should be translated into an operation. Even incorrect ones, like the 12-3 +5+12 which sums to 26, should be included with result_calc_error=True. 

So, putting it all together: start state, explore 12+12=24 (but that's invalid because remaining numbers are 3 and 5), then explore 12/3=4, then 12-3=9, then combinations of the results. Also, the final incorrect operation (12-3)+(5+12) should be an edge leading to (26), but since the participant submitted it, maybe they thought it was correct. 

I need to make sure each operation in the transcript is captured, even if it's wrong. Also, the code should handle the states correctly, sorting tuples each time.

Okay, let's tackle this problem. The start state is [8,9,12,13], and the participant's response was ""13x9"", which equals 117. But they didn't use all the numbers, so it's incorrect. The response time was 180 seconds, meaning they ran out of time.

Looking at the transcript, the participant tried several operations. First, they mentioned ""13 times 12, plus 9, divided by..."" which seems like they started with 13*12=156, then added 9 to get 165, but then got confused with division. They mentioned 17 and 85, maybe miscalculations. Then they tried 9*12=108, subtracted 13 to get 95. They also tried 13*8=104. Later, they mentioned 9*8=72 and 1*12=12, but those don't use all numbers. The final attempt was 13*9=117, but that leaves out 8 and 12.

I need to map each of these steps into the graph. Each operation they tried should be an edge from the current state to a new state. They backtracked a few times, so I'll use move_to_node when they return to the start state. Also, since they didn't solve it, the graph should end without reaching 24.

First, the initial attempt: 13*12=156. Then adding 9 and something with division. But since they didn't complete that thought, maybe just the first operation. Then they tried 9*12=108-13=95. Then 13*8=104. Then 9*8=72 and 1*12=12. Then 13*9=117. Each of these operations should be separate nodes. Also, they mentioned using paper, indicating confusion and multiple backtracks.

I'll start by creating the start state. Then each explore_operation for each calculation they tried. When they switch strategies, move back to the start state. Also, note any calculation errors. For example, 13*12 is 156, not 108. But the participant might have made errors, so the code should reflect that without correction.

Need to make sure each operation uses numbers from the current state. For example, when they do 13*12, those are in the start state. The resulting state would be (8,9,156). Then adding 9 would require having 156 and 9, but after using 13 and 12, the 9 is still there. Wait, no: when you perform an operation, you remove the two numbers used and add the result. So 13*12=156 would replace 13 and 12 with 156, so the new state is (8,9,156). Then adding 9 would be 156+9=165, but that would replace 156 and 9 with 165, leading to (8,165). But the participant might have tried that. However, in the transcript, they said ""plus 9, divided by..."" so maybe they tried 156 +9, then divided by something else. But since they didn't complete that, maybe only the first operation is recorded.

But the transcript is a bit messy. The participant jumps around a lot. So each distinct operation they mention should be a separate explore_operation. For example:

1. 13*12=156
2. Then maybe 156+9=165 (but they didn't finish)
3. Then they tried 9*12=108-13=95 (but 108-13 is 95, which uses 9,12,13, leaving 8)
4. Then 13*8=104 (using 13 and 8)
5. Then 9*8=72 (using 9 and 8)
6. Then 1*12=12 (but there's no 1 in the start state; wait, the start state is 8,9,12,13. Oh, the participant mentioned ""1 times 8"" and ""1 times 12"", but there's no 1. So that's a mistake. So maybe they thought there was a 1, which is a transcription error or a miscalculation. But according to the problem statement, we should handle ambiguous cases by making reasonable assumptions. So perhaps they meant 13-12=1? But the start state has 12 and 13. So maybe ""1 times 8"" was a mistake, but we have to include it as per their statement.

This complicates things. For example, if they say ""1 times 12"", but there's no 1, maybe they meant 13-12=1, then 1*12. But that would require multiple steps. Alternatively, it's a transcription error and they meant 13*12 or another operation.

Alternatively, the participant might have made a mistake in their calculations, like thinking 13-12=1, then using that 1. So in that case, we need to model that as an operation. But according to the code's rules, the numbers on the left of the operation must be present in the current state. So if they do 13-12=1, then that's allowed from the start state, resulting in (1,8,9). Then using that 1 for 1*12.

But the transcript mentions ""1 times 12 is 60"" which is incorrect. 1*12=12, but they might have made a calculation error. However, the code allows for result_calc_error=True.

So putting this all together, the code should create nodes and edges for each operation they tried, even if they are incorrect or use numbers not present (but according to the transcript, we have to assume they tried it, even if it's impossible). Wait, no: the code's guidelines state that the operation must use numbers present in the current state. So if the participant tries to use a number that's not there, like a 1 when there is no 1, that's an error. But according to the problem statement, we should handle transcription errors by making reasonable assumptions. So perhaps in such cases, we can infer that they meant to create a 1 via subtraction.

For example, when the participant says ""1 times 8"", but there's no 1, maybe they meant 9-8=1, then 1* something. But the code would need to model that as two operations: first subtracting to get 1, then multiplying. However, the transcript might not mention the steps explicitly.

This is getting complicated. Let's parse the transcript step by step.

Transcript:

""Alright, let's go. 13 times 12, plus 9, divided by, wait, oh man, 17, 17, plus 13, that's 85, 85, 9 times 12, that's 6 something, 9 times 12, 108, minus 13, 12 times 9, I need some paper and a pencil, dude, 13 times 8, So, I'm going to put 4. I'm going to put 12. I'm going to put 72. I'm going to put 1 times 8. 9 times 8 is 72. 1 times 12 is 60. 13 times 12. 13 times 1. 13 times 1. 117. 117 minus 12 is 105.""

Breaking it down:

1. 13 times 12 = 156 (start state has 13 and 12)
   - Then plus 9: 156 +9=165 (but this would require using 156 and 9, leading to 165, but then divided by something)
   - They mention 17, 17+13=30, which doesn't make sense here. Maybe miscalculations.

2. 9 times 12 = 108 (using 9 and 12)
   - Then minus 13: 108-13=95 (using 108 and 13, leaving 8 and 95?)

3. 13 times 8 = 104 (using 13 and 8)

4. Then mentions ""1 times 8"" (no 1 in start state, but maybe they thought 9-8=1)
   - 9 times 8 =72 (using 9 and 8)
   - 1 times 12=12 (again, no 1, but maybe from previous subtraction)
   - 13 times 12=156 again?

Okay, let's tackle this problem. The start state is [1,4,7,12], and the response given is (12/4)x(7+1). The transcript is a bit short and seems frustrated, but the key part is ""8 times 3."" Wait, the participant didn't mention 8 or 3 in the start state. Hmm, maybe they made a miscalculation or thought of intermediate steps.

First, the start state has 1,4,7,12. The correct answer uses 12 divided by 4 to get 3, then 7+1 is 8. So 3*8=24. But the participant in the transcript says ""8 times 3."" That makes sense because 8*3 is 24. But how do they get 8 and 3 from the start state?

Looking at the response they submitted: (12/4)=3 and (7+1)=8. So combining those gives 3*8=24. The transcript's ""8 times 3"" aligns with this. But the participant's verbalization might have been cut short or they mentioned the result of the operations rather than the steps. The frustration in the transcript might mean they didn't explain the steps clearly, but the response they submitted is correct.

So the Python code should first perform 12/4=3, then 7+1=8, then multiply them. The graph should show these steps. The initial state is (1,4,7,12). First, divide 12 by 4 to get (3,7,1). Then add 7 and 1 to get 8. Then multiply 3 and 8 to reach 24.

I need to use the explore_operation method for each step. The first operation is 12/4=3, resulting in state (1,3,7). Then in that state, add 7+1=8, resulting in (3,8). Then multiply 3*8=24. Each step should be a node in the graph with edges showing the operations. Also, check for any possible errors, but since the response is correct, the operations should be accurate.

Okay, let's try to figure out how to model the participant's thought process here. The start state is [2,3,7,9], and their response was (7x3), which is 21, but that's not 24. They probably tried to add something else but didn't get it right. 

Looking at the transcript, the participant starts by considering several operations. First, they mention ""nine divided by three is three"" which would give 3. Then they talk about adding 7, but that's 3 +7=10, which isn't helpful. They backtrack, thinking about 9-3=6, then 6*2=12, plus 7 is 19. Not enough. Then they try 7*3=21, which is their final answer. But they also tried to add 9/2 to that. Wait, they said ""7 times 3 is 21... plus 9 divided by 2"". But 9 divided by 2 is 4.5, so 21 +4.5=25.5, which isn't 24. But the participant realized that 9 divided by 2 isn't an integer, so that approach doesn't work.

So, the key steps here are exploring different operations but making some calculation errors. Let's break down each part of the transcript and map it to the graph operations.

First, the participant considers 9 divided by 3: 9/3=3. Then they mention adding 7, but that's 3+7=10, leaving out the 2. So that's an operation leading to state (2,10). But maybe they tried to do more? Wait, the transcript says ""plus seven you know and you add the two that's that's not going to be enough either"". Hmm, maybe they tried (9/3) +7 +2? That would be 3+7+2=12, but that's not mentioned clearly. Alternatively, maybe they tried 9/3=3, then 3+7=10, then 10*2=20. Not sure. Need to parse the transcript carefully.

Next, they consider 9-3=6, then 6*2=12, plus 7=19. So that's a series of operations. So first 9-3=6, leading to state (2,6,7). Then 6*2=12, leading to (7,12). Then 12+7=19, resulting in (19). But the participant might have done this step by step.

Then they try 7*3=21, which uses 7 and 3, leaving 2 and 9. So resulting state would be (2,9,21). Then they attempt 9 divided by 2, which is 4.5, leading to 21 +4.5=25.5. But since they realized that 9/2 isn't an integer, they abandon that. However, in the code, we need to represent their incorrect calculation if they thought it was 21 + something. Wait, in the transcript, they say ""plus 9 divided by 2. What? Incorrect answer or not on number. How come that's not right? If not, 7 times 3 is 21, right? Plus 9 divided by 2. 9 divided by 2. Oh, because 9 divided by 2 is 21. Oh, because 9 divided by 2 is 21. Oh, because 9 divided by 2 is 21. Because 2 does not go into 9 evenly. That's why."" Wait, that part is confusing. They seem to have a mistake here. Maybe they thought 9 divided by 2 equals 21? That's a big error. But then they correct themselves. So in their attempt, they tried 7*3=21, then added 9/2, but miscalculated 9/2 as 21? Or maybe they meant to say that 9 divided by (something else) but messed up.

Alternatively, maybe the participant intended to do (7*3) + (9/ something), but messed up the division. Since their final answer was (7x3), which is 21, but that's not 24, they probably didn't find a correct path.

So, in the code, we need to model each of these steps as operations, even if they are incorrect. Let's go step by step.

First, the participant starts with the initial state (2,3,7,9). They consider 9 divided by 3: 9/3=3. So that operation would remove 9 and 3, add 3. Resulting state is (2,3,7) but wait, original state is (2,3,7,9). So 9/3=3, so new numbers are 2,3 (from original 2 and remaining 3?), wait no. Wait, when you perform an operation, you take two numbers and replace them with the result. So 9 divided by 3 gives 3, so the new state would be (2,3,7) because you remove 9 and 3, add 3. Wait, but original numbers are 2,3,7,9. If you do 9/3=3, then the new state is 2,7,3 (since you used 9 and 3, leaving 2 and 7, then add 3). Wait, but that's a bit confusing. So the operation would take two numbers (9 and 3), combine them into 3 (from 9/3=3), so the new state is (2,7,3). Then the participant says ""plus seven you know and you add the two that's that's not going to be enough either"". So after getting to (2,7,3), maybe they add 7 and 3? Wait, but the participant's exact words are unclear. Alternatively, maybe they tried to do 9/3=3, then add 7 and 2. But the transcript is a bit ambiguous.

Alternatively, the participant might have considered multiple steps. Let's parse the transcript line by line.

Transcript:

""no that no that yeah no that wouldn't be because then i was gonna say because then if you do plus seven you know and you add the two that's that's not going to be enough either so that wouldn't work um let's see""

This part is a bit unclear. Maybe they tried (something) +7 +2, but not sure.

""well nine divided by three is three that's 15 though if you do that because i was gonna say and then no because you get and if you take away that would only give you 23 it wouldn't give you 24 if you do it that way""

Ah, here they say 9 divided by 3 is 3. Then ""that's 15 though if you do that"". Wait, how to get 15? Maybe 3 (from 9/3) plus 7 plus 2? 3+7+2=12. Not 15. Alternatively, maybe 9 divided by 3 is 3, then 3 * something. Not sure. Then ""if you take away"" maybe 9-3=6, then 6*2=12, plus 7=19. Then they mention ""that would only give you 23"". Hmm, conflicting numbers here. Maybe the participant is confused.

Continuing: ""because at first i was going to say you can do 9 minus the 3 which would be 6. even if you did that and then you times that by the two you know even if you times it by two that's only 12 plus seven is 19. that's not 24.""

Okay, this part is clearer. They tried 9-3=6 (using 9 and 3), new state is (2,6,7). Then 6*2=12 (using 6 and 2), new state (7,12). Then 12+7=19. So that's three operations. But in the code, each operation is a step. So first explore_operation for 9-3=6, then move_to_node to (2,6,7), then explore_operation for 6*2=12, then move_to_node to (7,12), then explore_operation for 12+7=19.

Then they say: ""But 7 times 3 is 21. And 9 divided by 2 would be 3. There you go. So do 7 times 3, which would be 21, right? And then do plus 9 divided by 2. What? Incorrect answer or not on number. How come that's not right? If not, 7 times 3 is 21, right? Plus 9 divided by 2. 9 divided by 2. Oh, because 9 divided by 2 is 21. Oh, because 9 divided by 2 is 21. Oh, because 9 divided by 2 is 21. Because 2 does not go into 9 evenly. That's why. Okay. So that would have worked if it would have been another 3.""

So here, the participant first does 7*3=21, using 7 and 3, leaving ",qwen3-235b-a22b,,False,,False,,

Okay, let's tackle this problem. The start state is [2,3,5,13], and the response given is (13-5-2)x3. The transcript shows the participant trying various operations but struggling until they figure out the correct path.

First, the participant starts by trying different combinations. They mention ""5 plus 2"" which gives 7, but then they get confused. They try 5 times 3 equals 15, then subtract 2 to get 13. That's not helpful. Then they try adding 5 and 13 to get 18, subtract 2 to get 16, which doesn't work. 

The key part comes when they say, ""How about 13 minus 5. So that's 13 minus 5 which equals 8. 13 minus 5 minus 2. That's 6 times 3."" Wait, 13-5 is 8, then subtract 2 gives 6. Then 6 multiplied by 3 equals 18? No, that's 18, not 24. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me check the response again. The correct answer is (13-5-2)x3. Let's compute that: 13-5=8, 8-2=6, 6x3=18. Wait, that's 18, not 24. Hmm, that can't be right. Oh, maybe there's a mistake here. Wait, maybe the participant made an error, but the response is supposed to be correct. Wait, maybe I miscalculated. Let me check again: 13-5=8, 8-2=6, 6x3=18. That's not 24. There's a problem here. But the response given is (13-5-2)x3. Maybe the participant made a mistake in their calculation, but the code should reflect their thought process, not the correctness.

Wait, looking back at the transcript: the participant says, ""13 minus 5 minus 2. That's 6 times 3. Okay, so 13 minus 5 is 8. 8."" So they might have intended 13-5=8, then 8-2=6, then 6x3=18. But that's not 24. There's a discrepancy here. Alternatively, maybe the participant meant (13 - (5 - 2)) * 3. Let's see: 5-2=3, 13-3=10, 10x3=30. Still not 24. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is different. Wait, let's check possible combinations. 

Wait, 13 - (5 + 2) =6, 6x3=18. Not helpful. What if we do (13 + 5 - 2) * 3? That would be 16*3=48. No. Alternatively, (13 - 5) * (3 - 2) = 8*1=8. Not helpful. Wait, maybe the correct answer is (13 - (5 - 2)) * 3. That would be (13 -3)=10 *3=30. Still not. Alternatively, maybe the participant made a mistake in their steps. But according to the response, the answer is (13-5-2)x3. Maybe the actual correct answer is different. Let me check if there's a valid solution. 

Another approach: 3*(5 - (13/2)). Wait, 13 divided by 2 is 6.5, 5 -6.5 is -1.5, multiplied by 3 gives -4.5. Not helpful. Alternatively, (13 - 3) * (5 - 2) = 10 *3=30. Still not. Hmm. Maybe this problem is unsolvable, but the participant submitted an incorrect answer. However, the response time is 180, meaning they didn't submit a correct answer. Wait, the response is given as (13-5-2)x3, which equals 18, which is incorrect. So perhaps the participant's answer was wrong, but the code should represent their steps.

In the transcript, the participant finally says they are going back to the drawing board and tries 13-5=8, then 8 minus 2=6, then times 3. So according to their transcript, they thought that 6x3=18, but maybe they made a mistake. However, the code should reflect their steps, even if incorrect.

So the code should model the steps they took: first, subtract 5 from 13 to get 8, then subtract 2 to get 6, then multiply by 3 to get 18. But since the response is (13-5-2)x3, the code should show that path. However, since the final result is 18, not 24, the code should mark the calculation error.

Wait, but the response given by the participant is (13-5-2)x3. Let's compute that: 13-5=8, 8-2=6, 6x3=18. So the participant's answer is incorrect, but the code should reflect their steps. Therefore, in the code, the final operation would be 6*3=18, which is a calculation error. But the transcript says ""That's 6 times 3. Okay, so 13 minus 5 is 8. 8."" but they might have thought that 6*3=24, which is a miscalculation. Wait, maybe the participant made a mistake in their mind, thinking that 6*3 is 24. Then the code should have result_calc_error=True.

So the steps would be:

1. Start with (2,3,5,13)
2. Do 13-5=8, resulting in (2,3,8)
3. Then do 8-2=6, resulting in (3,6)
4. Then do 6*3=24, which is a calculation error (since 6*3=18), but the participant thought it's 24.

But according to the transcript, the participant says ""That's 6 times 3. Okay, so 13 minus 5 is 8. 8."" but maybe they didn't complete the calculation. Alternatively, they might have intended to reach 24 but made a mistake.

So in the code:

- First, explore_operation for 13-5=8, resulting in (2,3,8)
- Then move_to_node to that state
- Then explore_operation for 8-2=6, resulting in (3,6)
- Then move_to_node to (3,6)
- Then explore_operation for 6*3=24, which is a calculation error (since 6*3=18), so result_calc_error=True.

But the participant's response is (13-5-2)x3, which would be equivalent to ((13-5)-2) *3. So the code should model that path, even if the calculation is wrong. Therefore, the code should have three steps: subtract 5 from 13, subtract 2, then multiply by 3. The final step would have a calculation error if the result is considered 24 when it's actually 18.

Alternatively, maybe the participant intended a different path. Let me check the transcript again.

In the transcript, the participant says: ""I'm going back to the drawing board. How about 13 minus 5. So that's 13 minus 5 which equals 1, 2, 3 equals 8. 13 minus 5 minus 2. That's 6 times 3. Okay, so 13 minus 5 is 8. 8."" 

So they do 13-5=8, then 8-2=6, then 6*3=18. But they might have thought that 6*3=24, which is a miscalculation. However, the transcript doesn't explicitly state the final result. The participant might have submitted the answer (13-5-2)*3, which equals 18, but thought it's 24. Therefore, in the code, the final operation should have result_calc_error=True.

So the code steps:

start_state = (2,3,5,13)

curr_state = start_state

First operation: 13-5=8, resulting in (2,3,8)

Then, 8-2=6, resulting in (3,6)

Then, 6*3=24 (which is incorrect, should be 18), so result_calc_error=True.

Thus, the code would have:

new_state1 = graph.explore_operation(curr_state, operation=""13-5=8"", resulting_state=(2,3,8), ...)

curr_state = move_to_node(new_state1)

new_state2 = explore_operation(... operation=""8-2=6"", resulting_state=(3,6), ...)

curr_state = move_to_node(new_state2)

new_state3 = explore_operation(... operation=""6*3=24"", resulting_state=(24,), result_calc_error=True, ...)

But according to the participant's response, the answer is (1",qwen3-235b-a22b,,False,,False,,

Okay, let's tackle this problem. The start state is [1, 8, 10, 12], and the response given is 1x(10-8)x12. The transcript mentions doing 10 minus 8 to get 2, then multiplying by 12 and 1. 

First, I need to map the participant's thought process into the GraphBuilder code. The participant starts by listing the numbers, then focuses on 10-8=2. That's an operation replacing 10 and 8 with 2. Then they multiply that result by 12 and 1. But since each operation combines two numbers, I need to break this down step by step.

So first, the participant does 10-8=2. That would create a new state with 1, 2, 12. Then, they multiply 2 and 12 to get 24, leaving 1. Finally, multiply 24 by 1, which doesn't change the value but uses all numbers. However, in the game, all numbers must be used exactly once. The response uses 1, 10, 8, 12 correctly.

Wait, the operations need to combine two numbers each time. The response is 1*(10-8)*12. Let's parse that: first, 10-8=2, then multiply by 12 to get 24, then multiply by 1. But since each operation is binary, the steps would be:

1. Subtract 8 from 10 → 2. New state: [1, 2, 12]
2. Multiply 2 and 12 → 24. New state: [1, 24]
3. Multiply 24 and 1 → 24. Final state.

But in the game, you have to use all numbers exactly once. So each step must use two numbers until all are used. The participant's answer does that by using 10-8 (two numbers), then multiplying by 12 (third number), then multiplying by 1 (fourth number). However, each operation combines two numbers. So the steps are valid.

In the transcript, the participant says ""10 minus 8, that's 2 times 12 is 24, times 1"". So the code should reflect these steps. 

So first, the explore_operation for 10-8=2. Resulting state (1, 2, 12). Then multiply 2 and 12 to get 24, then multiply 24 and 1. But the response given is 1x(10-8)x12, which groups 1 with the rest. However, the order of operations might affect the steps. Let me check the actual operations.

Wait, the participant's final answer is 1*(10-8)*12. Depending on order, this could be (1*(10-8))*12 or 1*((10-8)*12). The first would be (1*2)*12=24, which works. The second would be 1*(2*12)=24. Either way, the steps are combining two at a time.

So first, subtract 8 from 10 to get 2. Then multiply that 2 with 12 to get 24. Then multiply by 1. But multiplying 24 by 1 doesn't change anything, but it's necessary to use all numbers.

So in the code:

Start with (1,8,10,12). 

First operation: 10-8=2 → new state (1,2,12). 

Then, multiply 2 and 12 → 24, new state (1,24). 

Then multiply 24 and 1 → 24. 

But each of these steps needs to be represented with explore_operation and move_to_node as needed.

Looking at the previous examples, after each operation, you might need to move_to_node to proceed. 

So code steps:

1. Initialize graph with start_state (1,8,10,12).

2. First operation: 10-8=2. Resulting state (1,2,12). Use explore_operation on start_state.

3. Then move_to_node to (1,2,12).

4. Multiply 2 and 12 → 24. Resulting state (1,24).

5. Then move_to_node to (1,24).

6. Multiply 24 and 1 → 24. Resulting state (24,).

But wait, in step 4, when you multiply 2 and 12, the resulting state is (1, 24). Then, to combine 1 and 24, you need to do 24*1=24, leading to (24,). 

So each operation step must be captured. Let's code each of these steps.

Also, the transcript mentions ""10 minus 8, that's 2 times 12 is 24, times 1"". So the participant might have done the steps as 10-8, then multiply by 12, then multiply by 1. 

But each operation is between two numbers. So first, 10-8=2 (using 10 and 8), then 2*12=24 (using 2 and 12), then 24*1=24 (using 24 and 1). Each step uses the result from the previous operation. 

Therefore, the code should have three operations. Let's structure that.

First, the first operation is 10-8=2. Resulting state (1,2,12). 

Then, move to that state and do 2*12=24, resulting in (1,24). 

Then move to (1,24) and do 24*1=24. 

Each of these steps should be added as explore_operation calls. 

Now, checking the code structure. The GraphBuilder's explore_operation function handles each operation, creating edges between states. 

So the code would be:

start_state = (1,8,10,12)
curr_state = start_state
graph = GraphBuilder(start_state)

# First operation: 10-8=2
new_state = graph.explore_operation(
    curr_state,
    operation=""10-8=2"",
    resulting_state=(1,2,12),
    comment='""10 minus 8, that\'s 2""',
)

# Move to the new state (1,2,12)
curr_state = graph.move_to_node(new_state)

# Multiply 2 and 12 to get 24
new_state = graph.explore_operation(
    curr_state,
    operation=""2*12=24"",
    resulting_state=(1,24),
    comment='""times 12 is 24""',
)

# Move to (1,24)
curr_state = graph.move_to_node(new_state)

# Multiply 24 and 1 to get 24
new_state = graph.explore_operation(
    curr_state,
    operation=""24*1=24"",
    resulting_state=(24,),
    comment='""times 1""',
)

This should model the participant's steps correctly. Each operation is a step in the graph, leading from the start state through intermediate states to the goal. 

I should also check if the resulting states are correctly sorted. For example, (1,2,12) should be sorted as (1,2,12), which is already in order. Similarly, (1,24) is correct. 

The participant's response is 1x(10-8)x12, which aligns with this approach. The code captures each binary operation step, even though the final multiplication by 1 doesn't change the value but uses the remaining number. 

This should be the correct way to represent the participant's thought process in the code.

Okay, let's tackle this problem. The start state is [3,9,13,13], and the response given is (13-9)+13(-3). Wait, that doesn't look right. Let me parse that. Oh, maybe it's supposed to be (13 - 9) * (13 - 3) or something else? Because 13(-3) would be -39, but the participant's transcript mentions 13 minus 9 plus 13 minus 3. Let me check the transcript again.

The transcript says: ""13 minus 9 plus 13 minus 3. I think this is right."" So the participant is combining these operations. Let's see, 13 - 9 is 4, then plus 13 would be 17, minus 3 is 14. That's not 24. Hmm, maybe there's a different grouping. Wait, maybe they meant (13 - 9) + (13 * 3)? Let's calculate that: 4 + 39 = 43. No, that's not it. Alternatively, maybe they made a mistake in their calculation.

Wait, the response they submitted is (13-9)+13(-3). Let me check if that's valid. The original numbers are two 13s, a 9, and a 3. The operations need to use each number once. Let's see: (13 - 9) uses 13 and 9, leaving 13 and 3. Then adding 13(-3) would be multiplying 13 and -3, but that would require using the 3 again, which isn't allowed. Wait, maybe the response has a typo. Alternatively, maybe the intended solution is (13 - (9 + 13 / -3))? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the correct solution is (13 - 9) * (13 - 3) = 4 * 10 = 40, which is not 24. Hmm. Let me think. The participant's transcript says they tried 13 minus 9 plus 13 minus 3. Let's compute that step by step: 13-9=4, 4+13=17, 17-3=14. Not 24. So maybe the participant made a mistake in their calculation, or the response is incorrect.

But according to the problem, the response is (13-9)+13(-3). Wait, maybe the intended solution is (13 - 9) * 13 - 3? Let's compute that: 4*13=52-3=49. No. Alternatively, 13 - (9 + 13) / -3? Let's see: (9 +13)=22, 22/-3 is -7.333, subtract that from 13? 13 - (-7.333) is 20.333. Not 24.

Alternatively, maybe the correct solution is (13 + 13) * (9 - 3) / something? Wait, 13+13=26, 9-3=6. 26*6=156. Not helpful. Or 13*(3 - (13-9))? Let's see: 13-9=4, 3-4=-1, 13*-1=-13. No.

Wait, maybe the participant made a mistake in their response. Let's look at the transcript again. They said ""13 minus 9 plus 13 minus 3."" So that's 13-9=4, +13=17, -3=14. Not 24. Then they say ""I think this is right."" But that's not correct. So perhaps the participant submitted an incorrect answer, but we need to model their thought process.

In the transcript, they also mentioned ""13 plus 13 equals 26 plus 3"" which would be 29, but that leaves out the 9. Then ""13 times 3 equals 39 minus 13"" which would be 26. So 13*3=39-13=26. But that uses 13,3,13, leaving out the 9. Not valid.

So the participant's thought process seems to have tried several combinations but ended up with an incorrect solution. The code needs to model their steps, even if incorrect.

So the steps in the transcript are:

- ""13 plus 13 equals 26 plus 3"" → 13+13+3=29 (missing the 9)
- ""13 times 3 equals 39 minus 13"" → 13*3-13=26 (missing the 9)
- Then ""13 minus 9 plus 13 minus 3"" → 14

But none of these reach 24. However, the response they submitted is (13-9)+13(-3). Let's parse that. If it's (13-9) + 13*(-3) = 4 -39 = -35, which is not 24. So the response is incorrect, but the code should represent their steps.

So the code should model the operations they mentioned, even if they don't reach 24. Let's map the transcript to code.

First, the start state is (3,9,13,13). The participant first tries 13+13+3, but that would be using two 13s and the 3, leaving out the 9. So:

new_state = graph.explore_operation(
    curr_state,
    operation=""13+13+3=29"",
    resulting_state=(9, 29),
    comment='""13 plus 13 equals 26 plus 3""',
)

Then they try 13*3=39-13=26:

curr_state = graph.move_to_node(start_state)
new_state = graph.explore_operation(
    curr_state,
    operation=""13*3-13=26"",
    resulting_state=(9, 26),
    comment='""13 times 3 equals 39 minus 13""',
)

Then they try 13-9=4, then +13-3:

curr_state = graph.move_to_node(start_state)
new_state = graph.explore_operation(
    curr_state,
    operation=""13-9=4"",
    resulting_state=(3,4,13),
    comment='""13 minus 9""',
)

curr_state = graph.move_to_node(new_state)
new_state = graph.explore_operation(
    curr_state,
    operation=""4+13=17"",
    resulting_state=(3,17),
    comment='""plus 13""',
)

curr_state = graph.move_to_node(new_state)
new_state = graph.explore_operation(
    curr_state,
    operation=""17-3=14"",
    resulting_state=(14,),
    comment='""minus 3""',
)

But since the participant submitted a response, even though it's incorrect, perhaps they combined operations in a way that uses all numbers. The response is (13-9)+13(-3). Wait, maybe the intended operation is (13-9) + (13 * (-3))? But that would be 4 + (-39) = -35. Alternatively, maybe there's a typo and it's (13-9) * (13 - something). But the participant's transcript says ""13 minus 9 plus 13 minus 3"", which is a linear sequence. Since the code needs to model their steps, even if incorrect, we need to represent the operations they tried, even if they don't reach 24.

Alternatively, maybe the participant intended a different grouping. For example, 13 - 9 + 13 - 3 = 14, but they thought it equals 24. So the code should model that as a miscalculation.

So the final step would be combining all into 14, but the participant thought it's 24. However, the response they submitted is different. The response is (13-9)+13(-3), which might be a different approach. Let's parse that. The expression as written is (13-9) + 13*(-3), but that uses each number once: 13,9,13,3. Wait, no: (13-9) uses one 13 and 9. Then 13*(-3) uses another 13 and the 3. But that's using two 13s, which are available. Wait, the start state has two 13s. So:

(13 - 9) uses one 13 and 9. Then +13*(-3) uses the other 13 and 3. So all four numbers are used. But the calculation is 4 + (-39) = -35. So the response is incorrect, but the code should model the participant's attempt.

So in code:

Okay, let's see. The start state is [7,9,11,11]. The response given is (11+9)+(11-7). The transcript says the participant did 11+9=20, then 11-7=4, then added those two results to get 24. 

First, I need to model the steps the participant took. The first step they mention is 11+9, which gives 20. So I should use the explore_operation method for that. The current state is (7,9,11,11), and after adding 11 and 9, the resulting state would be (7,11,20). 

Next, they take the other 11 and subtract 7 to get 4. So from the state (7,11,20), they need to do 11-7. Wait, but after the first operation, the numbers used (11 and 9) are replaced by 20. So the remaining numbers would be 7, 11, and 20. Wait, the original state has two 11s. So when they add one 11 and 9, those two are used, leaving the other 11 and 7. Then in the next step, they use the remaining 11 and 7. So after the first operation, the state is (11,7,20). Then they do 11-7=4, leading to (20,4). 

Then they add 20 and 4 to get 24. So the steps are: first operation 11+9=20, then 11-7=4, then 20+4=24. 

Wait, but in the transcript, the participant says ""11 plus 9, which gives me 20, plus 11, delete that, 11 minus 7 should get me 24."" Hmm, maybe they initially thought of adding all three numbers but then corrected themselves. The ""delete that"" part suggests they changed their approach. So the correct path is first 11+9=20, then 11-7=4, then 20+4=24.

So in the code, first, create the graph with the start state. Then, first explore_operation is 11+9=20, resulting in (7,11,20). Then move_to_node to that state. Then explore_operation 11-7=4, resulting in (4,20). Then move_to_node to that state and explore_operation 20+4=24.

Wait, but in the first step, the original numbers are two 11s. So when they use 11 and 9, one 11 is used, leaving another 11, 7, and 20. So the state after first operation is (7,11,20). Then in the next step, they use 11 and 7, which are present, so 11-7=4. That would leave 20 and 4. Then adding them gives 24.

So the code steps:

start_state = (7,9,11,11)
graph = GraphBuilder(start_state)
curr_state = start_state

First operation: 11+9=20. The resulting state is (7,11,20). So:

new_state1 = graph.explore_operation(
    curr_state,
    operation=""11+9=20"",
    resulting_state=(7,11,20),
    comment=""Participant adds 11 and 9 to get 20.""
)

Then move to new_state1:

curr_state = graph.move_to_node(new_state1)

Then explore_operation 11-7=4. The resulting state is (4,20):

new_state2 = graph.explore_operation(
    curr_state,
    operation=""11-7=4"",
    resulting_state=(4,20),
    comment=""Participant subtracts 7 from 11 to get 4.""
)

Then move to new_state2:

curr_state = graph.move_to_node(new_state2)

Then explore_operation 20+4=24:

new_state3 = graph.explore_operation(
    curr_state,
    operation=""20+4=24"",
    resulting_state=(24,),
    comment=""Participant adds 20 and 4 to reach 24.""
)

But wait, the participant's response is (11+9)+(11-7). So the operations are indeed these steps. The code should reflect each individual operation. Also, the order of the numbers in the resulting_state should be sorted tuples. For example, (7,11,20) should be sorted as (7,11,20), but when stored in the graph, they are sorted tuples. The code's explore_operation function sorts the resulting_state automatically.

Wait, looking back at the code for explore_operation, the first line is curr_state = tuple(sorted(curr_state)), and the same for resulting_state. So when we pass (7,11,20), it will be stored as (7,11,20) since sorted. Similarly, (4,20) becomes (4,20).

So the code steps should be correct. Also, the comments should reflect the transcript. The participant's transcript mentions each step, so the comments can be taken from that.

Another thing: the participant's transcript says ""plus 11, delete that, 11 minus 7"". So they initially thought of adding another 11 but then deleted that idea and did 11-7 instead. So the code should not include that incorrect path. The code only includes the steps they actually took. So the code as above should be correct.

So putting it all together, the Python code would first perform the 11+9, then 11-7, then add the two results. Each step is an explore_operation, with move_to_node in between to navigate the graph.

Okay, let's tackle this problem. The start state is [4,8,8,12], and the response given was 12+8+(8-4). The transcript mentions several operations, so I need to map each part of the participant's thought process into the graph using the provided methods.

First, the participant starts by considering divisions. They say ""8 divided by 8 is 1, divided by 4"" which might be a miscalculation. So I should use explore_operation for 8/8=1, resulting in a new state (4,1,12). Then, maybe they try 1/4, but that's not correct, so another operation with result_calc_error=True.

Next, they mention ""12 divided by 4 is 3, times 8"". So 12/4=3, leading to state (3,8,8). Then multiplying 3*8=24, but since they have two 8s, maybe they use one 8 here. However, the response they submitted uses addition and subtraction, so maybe this path was a dead end.

Then they try ""8 plus 12 is 20"" which would be an operation 8+12=20, resulting in (4,8,20). Then ""plus 8 minus 4"" which is 20+8-4=24. But the order here matters. The participant might have first added 12+8, then added another 8 and subtracted 4. So breaking it down step by step: 12+8=20 (state (4,8,20)), then 20+8=28 (state (4,28)), then 28-4=24. But each operation can only combine two numbers at a time. Wait, the explore_operation function allows operations that combine multiple steps as long as the left side numbers are present. However, according to the guidelines, each operation must replace two numbers with a new one. So for 12+8+(8-4), the participant might have first done 8-4=4, then added 12+8+4. But the transcript says ""plus 8 minus 4 that way"", which might be 12+8=20, then 20 + (8-4)=24. So breaking into two steps: first 8-4=4 (using one 8 and 4), then 12+8+4. Wait, but each operation can only combine two numbers. So maybe first 8-4=4, leading to state (4,8,12) becomes (8,12,4). Then adding 12+8=20, then 20+4=24. But the participant's final response is 12+8+(8-4), which is 12+8+4=24. So the steps would be:

1. 8-4=4 (using one 8 and 4)
2. Then 12+8=20 (using 12 and the other 8)
3. Then 20+4=24

But each operation must be a single step. Alternatively, the participant might have combined the operations in a different order. Let me check the transcript again.

The transcript ends with ""plus. 8 minus 4. That way."" So after adding 12+8=20, they add (8-4)=4 to get 20+4=24. So the steps are:

- 12+8=20 (using one 8)
- 8-4=4 (using the other 8 and 4)
- Then 20+4=24

But each operation is a separate step. So first, the participant does 12+8=20, resulting in (4,8,20). Then they do 8-4=4, which would take the remaining 8 and 4, leading to (20,4,8) → but after removing 8 and 4, adding 4, so new state is (20,4,8) becomes (20,4) if both 8 and 4 are used? Wait, no. Wait, each operation takes two numbers from the current state and replaces them with the result. So for example, starting with (4,8,8,12):

First operation: 12+8=20. So remove 12 and 8, add 20. New state is (4,8,20). Then next operation: take 8 and 4 from (4,8,20), do 8-4=4. Remove 8 and 4, add 4. New state is (4,20). Then add 20+4=24. So three operations.

But the participant's response is a single expression: 12+8+(8-4), which combines these steps. However, according to the problem's rules, each operation must combine two numbers at a time. So the code should break this into multiple steps.

In the transcript, the participant mentions ""12 divided by 4 is 3, times 8"" which they might have tried first. Then they backtrack and try adding 12+8, then 8-4.

So the code should first explore the division paths, then backtrack and try the correct path.

So steps in code:

1. Start with (4,8,8,12)
2. Explore 8/8=1, resulting in (4,1,12)
3. Then explore 1/4=0.25 (but participant says ""arguing 2"" which might be a miscalculation, so result_calc_error=True)
4. Then explore 12/4=3, resulting in (3,8,8)
5. Then explore 3*8=24, resulting in (24,8)
6. Then participant backtracks, moves back to start state
7. Explore 12+8=20, resulting in (4,8,20)
8. Then move to that state and explore 8-4=4, resulting in (20,4)
9. Then move to (20,4) and explore 20+4=24

But the participant's response is 12+8+(8-4), which is the combination of steps 7,8,9.

So the code should include all these steps, including the initial incorrect attempts.

Also, the transcript mentions ""12 divided by 8, that's not it"" which should be another explore_operation.

So putting it all together:

- Start state (4,8,8,12)
- Try 8/8=1 → (1,4,12)
- Then 1/4=0.25 (but participant says ""arguing 2"", so result_calc_error=True)
- Then try 12/4=3 → (3,8,8)
- Then 3*8=24 → (24,8)
- Then try 12/8=1.5 → (1.5,4,8)
- Then backtrack to start state
- Try 12+8=20 → (4,8,20)
- Then 8-4=4 → (20,4,8) → after removing 8 and 4, add 4 → new state (20,4)
- Then 20+4=24 → (24)

Each of these steps would be explore_operation and move_to_node as needed.

Also, the participant's final correct path is the last three steps. So the code should reflect all the attempts, including the incorrect ones, and the correct path leading to the solution.

Okay, let's try to figure out how to model this participant's thought process into the graph structure. The start state is [7,7,11,12], and they didn't submit a response, so they probably didn't find a solution. The transcript shows some attempts and backtracking.

First, the participant starts by saying ""12 minus 11, 12 minus 11, times 7 plus 7."" So they're trying 12-11=1, then multiplying that by (7+7). Wait, but 7+7 is 14. So 1*14=14, which isn't 24. But the participant might have thought that (12-11)=1, then 1 times 7 plus 7? But that would be 8. Hmm, maybe they meant (12-11)*(7+7) = 1*14=14. So that's an operation they tried. So I should use explore_operation here with that calculation, even though it's incorrect.

Next, they say ""nope, 12 minus 11 is 1, 1 times, I don't know. Add fortune, no, no. Add fortune."" Not sure what ""add fortune"" refers to. Maybe a typo or mishearing. But they might be trying different combinations here. Then they mention trying again: ""11 minus 4 4 11 minus 2 4 use each number at once."" Wait, this part is confusing. The original numbers are 7,7,11,12. Where are they getting 4 from? Maybe transcription errors here. The participant might have meant 12-7=5, then 11-5=6? Not sure. Alternatively, they might be trying to create numbers like 4 through operations, but that's not possible with the given numbers. This part is ambiguous, but I'll have to make a reasonable assumption. Maybe they tried 11 - (12 - 7) = 6, but that's a stretch. Alternatively, maybe they tried combining numbers in a way that's not possible, leading to confusion.

Then they mention ""12 minus 7 times 11 minus 7."" Let's parse that. Order of operations would be 12 - (7*11) = 12-77= -65, which is way off. But maybe they meant (12-7)*(11-7) = 5*4=20. That's a possible path. If they did that, then they'd have 20, but then how to get to 24? Maybe adding the remaining numbers? Wait, but all numbers would have been used in that case. Wait, original numbers are 7,7,11,12. If they do (12-7)=5 and (11-7)=4, then multiply 5*4=20. But then they've used all numbers except... Wait, no, each number can only be used once. So if you do 12-7 and 11-7, you're using both 7s, so that's allowed. Then you have 5 and 4, but then you have no numbers left. Wait, but each operation combines two numbers into one, so each operation reduces the count by one. Starting with four numbers, each operation reduces to three, then two, then one. So in this case, first step: 12-7=5, resulting in 5,7,11. Then 11-7=4, resulting in 4,5. Then 5*4=20. But that's not 24. So maybe they tried that path but it didn't work.

Alternatively, maybe they tried 7*(12-11+7) = 7*(1+7)=56. Not helpful. Or 12*(11-7)/7? Not sure. The participant seems to be struggling here, trying different combinations but not finding the right path.

In the code, I need to represent each of their attempts as operations. The first attempt is (12-11)*(7+7)=14. Then maybe moving back and trying (12-7) and (11-7), but that leads to 5 and 4. Then multiplying them to get 20. Also, there's a mention of ""clock"" indicating time is running out, so they didn't finish.

So the code would start with the initial state. Then explore the first operation. Then backtrack, try other operations. Since they didn't find a solution, the graph would have multiple paths but no connection to 24. Also, the participant might have set a subgoal, but not sure. Let's see the code steps:

1. Start with (7,7,11,12).

2. First operation: (12-11)=1, then 7+7=14. Then 1*14=14. So the operation is (12-11)*(7+7)=14. Resulting state is (14, 1) but wait, no. Wait, when you do 12-11=1, you have to combine those two into 1, leaving 7,7,1. Then adding 7+7=14 would require using both 7s, leading to 14 and 1 and 12? No, I'm getting confused. Wait, each operation must combine two numbers. So the first step could be (12-11)=1. Then the state becomes (1,7,7). Then in that state, adding 7+7=14. The new state would be (1,14). Then multiplying them: 1*14=14. So each of these steps would be separate operations. But the participant might have thought of combining them all in one step, which the code might need to split into sub-operations.

But according to the code's explore_operation function, each operation is a single equation. So if the participant says ""times 7 plus 7"", that would be part of the same operation. So the operation string would be ""(12-11)*(7+7)=14"". The code's get_sub_operations function would split this into sub-operations: first 12-11=1, then 7+7=14, then 1*14=14. Each of these would be edges in the graph. But the code's explore_operation function handles that by splitting the operation into sub-operations. So in the code, when we call explore_operation with operation=""(12-11)*(7+7)=14"", the sub_operations would be the individual steps. However, the code's example shows that if the operation is ""9-3=6"", it's a single sub_operation. But if it's a multi-step operation, like ""a op b = c; c op d = e"", then it would split into those steps.

But in the transcript, the participant might have done all that in one go, so we need to model that as a single operation leading to (14,1), then multiplying to get 14. Wait, no. Let me think again. The operation ""(12-11)*(7+7)=14"" would result in the state (14), because all four numbers are used: 12,11,7,7. The first part (12-11) uses 12 and 11, resulting in 1. Then 7+7 uses both 7s, resulting in 14. Then multiplying 1 and 14 gives 14, but that would require using the results of previous operations. However, in the game, each operation combines two numbers into one, reducing the count each time. So you can't do two operations in one step. Therefore, the participant's approach of combining all four numbers in one operation isn't allowed. So the code should model this as multiple steps.

Wait, but the participant might have thought of it as a single operation. The code's explore_operation function allows for multi-step operations by splitting them into sub-operations. For example, in the example where the operation is ""9*3=27"" and then ""27-3=24"", the code splits it into sub-operations. So in this case, the code would split ""(12-11)*(7+7)=14"" into sub-operations: first 12-11=1, then 7+7=14, then 1*14=14. But each of these steps would create intermediate states. However, the code's add_connected_node function would handle each sub-operation as a separate edge.

But according to the code's guidelines, each operation must replace two numbers from the current state. So the participant's attempt to do (12-11)*(7+7) in one step isn't valid because you can't do two operations at once. Therefore, the code should model this as an incorrect approach, perhaps as a single operation that's invalid. Wait, but the code's explore_operation function requires that the operation uses numbers present in the current state. So if the current state is (7,7,11,12), you can't do (12-11) and (7+7) at the same time because each operation reduces the state. So first, you'd have to do one of those operations, then proceed",qwen3-235b-a22b,,False,,False,,

Okay, let's tackle this problem. The start state is [7,8,8,12], and the participant didn't submit a response, so they probably couldn't find a solution in the 180 seconds. The transcript shows they tried several operations but kept getting stuck.

First, the participant starts by mentioning the numbers 7,8,8,12. They try 12+8, which doesn't work. Then they go for 12*8=96. That's a big number, so maybe they thought of dividing by something else. They also tried 8*7, which is 56, but that's not mentioned. Wait, the transcript says ""8 times 8 is 34"" which is a clear error because 8*8 is 64. Maybe they meant 8+8=16? But they said 34. That's confusing. Then they mention 12*7, which is 84, and subtract 34 (maybe from the earlier wrong 8*8=34?), leading to 50? Not sure. They keep saying it's not working.

I need to map their attempts into the graph. Each operation they tried should be an edge. The incorrect calculations should be noted with result_calc_error=True. For example, when they said 8*8=34, that's a wrong operation. Also, when they tried 12*8=96, that's a valid operation but leading to a state that doesn't help. They might have tried combining 96 with the remaining numbers, but the transcript isn't clear. 

Wait, the participant says ""12 times 8. That will be 96."" So that's a correct operation. Then they mention 8 times 7, which is 56, but they didn't state what they did with that. Maybe they tried 96 divided by something? The transcript isn't clear. Then they say ""8 times 8 is 34"" which is wrong. Then 12*7=84 minus 34 (which was their incorrect 8*8) gives 50? Not sure. They end up frustrated, saying it's not working.

So in the code, each of their operations should be added. The correct ones like 12*8=96, and incorrect ones like 8*8=34. Also, when they backtrack, we need to use move_to_node to return to previous states. Since they tried multiple paths, the graph should reflect all their attempts, even the wrong ones. 

I need to structure the Python code using the GraphBuilder class. Start with the initial state, then explore each operation step by step as per the transcript. For each operation mentioned, create an explore_operation call, noting any calculation errors. Also, handle backtracking if they return to a previous state. The final code should represent all their attempts, showing the different paths they tried even if they didn't reach the solution.

Okay, let's tackle this problem. The start state is [1, 3, 3, 10], and the correct response is (10-3+1)x3. The participant's transcript shows they struggled a bit but eventually found the solution.

First, I need to map the participant's thought process into the GraphBuilder code. Let's go through the transcript step by step.

The participant starts by saying ""10 times 3 is too high."" So they tried 10*3=30, which leaves 1 and 3 unused. That's an operation to add.

Then, ""You can get 7 times 3, 21. That's too low."" So they considered 10-3=7, then 7*3=21. That's two operations: first 10-3=7, leading to state (1,3,7), then 7*3=21, leaving 1 and 21. But since 21 isn't 24, they moved on.

Next, ""9 times 20. 3 times 3 is not. Plus 10 is not enough."" There's some confusion here. Maybe they tried 3*3=9, then 9+10=19, but that's not helpful. Or perhaps they mentioned 3*3=9 but realized it's not useful. This part might involve a few operations, but some might be errors.

""7 times 3. I already went over that. 6. 4. Times 7. No. 7. 4 minus 3 is 1."" They might have tried combining numbers in different ways, like 4 (from where?) but since the original numbers are 1,3,3,10, maybe they miscalculated. For example, 10-3-1=6, then 6*3=18. But that's not 24. Or maybe they tried (10 - (3 +1)) which is 6, then 6*3=18. 

The participant then says, ""Okay. 6. 0. 6 times 3 is 18. No. How do I get 24? 8 times 3. Is there a way to get 8?"" They're looking for 8 to multiply by 3. How to get 8? From 10- (3-1)? Wait, 10 - (3-1) = 10 -2 =8. So that's 10 - (3-1) =8, then 8*3=24. But the correct answer is (10-3+1)*3. Which is equivalent because 10-3 is 7 +1 is 8, so same as 8*3. 

In the transcript, the final solution is mentioned as ""10 minus 3 plus 1 times 3."" So the operation is (10 -3 +1) *3 = 8*3=24. 

So the steps would be: first combine 10-3=7, then add 1 to get 8, then multiply by 3. But in the operations, each step should combine two numbers. So the first operation could be (10 -3) =7, leading to state (1,3,7). Then, 7 +1 =8, leading to (3,8). Then 8*3=24. Alternatively, combining 10,3,1 in one step as (10-3+1)=8, which uses 10,3,1, leaving 3, then 8*3=24. 

But according to the rules, each operation must replace two numbers. So each step should be a binary operation. So the correct path would be:

1. 10 - 3 =7 → new state (1,3,7)
2. 7 +1 =8 → new state (3,8)
3. 8 *3 =24 → new state (24)

Alternatively, if the participant did (10 -3 +1) as a single step, but since operations are binary, maybe they first did 3-1=2, then 10-2=8, then 8*3=24. But the transcript says ""10 minus 3 plus 1"", which would be (10 -3) +1 =8. 

So the code should reflect these steps. Also, the participant might have backtracked after trying other operations. 

In the code, we need to create the graph by exploring each operation step, including any incorrect ones they tried, and then the correct path. The final correct operation is (10-3+1)*3, which would be broken into steps. 

So the correct code would first explore the incorrect attempts, then arrive at the correct operations. The participant's transcript mentions several failed attempts before arriving at the solution. So the code should include those as well. For example, trying 10*3=30, 10-3=7 then 7*3=21, trying 3*3=9, etc. Then finally, the correct path of 10-3=7, 7+1=8, 8*3=24. 

Also, the participant might have moved back to previous states after trying other things. For example, after trying some operations, they backtrack to the start state and try a different approach. 

Putting this all together, the code should first add the start state, then explore each operation mentioned in the transcript, including errors, and then finally the correct path leading to 24. The set_subgoal might be used if the participant mentioned aiming for a specific intermediate value, like 8 or 21, but in this case, they mentioned 8 times 3, so maybe setting a subgoal for 8. 

So the final code would have multiple explore_operation calls for each attempted operation, some leading to dead ends, and then the correct sequence. Also, move_to_node calls when the participant backtracks.

Okay, let's tackle this problem. The start state is [4,4,7,7], and the response given was 7x(4-(4/7)). The participant took 167 seconds, which is almost the full time, so they probably struggled a bit.

First, looking at the transcript. The participant mentions 8 times 3, but there's no 8 in the numbers. Wait, the start state has 4,4,7,7. Maybe they thought of combining numbers to make 8? Like 4+4=8. Then 3 could come from 7-4. So 8*3=24. But they have to use all numbers. Let me check that approach.

But the correct solution uses fractions. The answer is 7*(4 - (4/7)). Let's break that down. 4 divided by 7 is 4/7. Subtract that from 4 to get 24/7. Multiply by 7 gives 24. Then the remaining 4 is used? Wait, no. Wait, the original numbers are two 4s and two 7s. In the solution, all numbers are used: one 7, one 4, another 4, and another 7. Let me see: 4/7 uses one 4 and one 7. Then 4 - (4/7) uses another 4. Multiply by 7 uses the remaining 7. So yes, all four numbers are used. So the operations involve fractions, which might be tricky.

In the transcript, the participant tried 7-4=3, then 3 times 8 (which would be 24). But how to get 8? 4+4=8. So that's a possible path. Let's see if the participant mentioned that. The transcript says: ""8 times 3, oh, 7 minus 4 is 3, and then..."" So they might have thought of 4+4=8, then 7-4=3, then 8*3=24. But does that use all numbers? Let's check: 4,4,7,7. 4+4=8, 7-4=3. Wait, but using two 4s and one 7, leaving the other 7. Then multiply 8*3=24, but that would leave the other 7 unused. So that approach might not work. Maybe the participant realized that and backtracked.

The participant also tried 7*7=49, then 49-16=33, which doesn't help. So they were stuck. The correct solution requires a different approach with fractions.

So in the code, the participant's steps might include trying to make 3 from 7-4, then trying to get 8 from 4+4, but failing to use all numbers. Then maybe trying divisions. The correct solution involves division, so the code should reflect that operation. The participant might have explored some incorrect operations before arriving at the correct one, but since the response time is 167 seconds, they might have submitted the answer near the end.

The code should use the explore_operation method to represent the steps. The correct answer is 7*(4 - (4/7)), so the steps would be:

1. Divide 4 by 7: 4/7 = 0.571...
2. Subtract that result from 4: 4 - (4/7) = 24/7 ≈3.428...
3. Multiply that by 7: (24/7)*7 =24.

Each of these steps would be operations. However, the participant's transcript doesn't clearly state this. They might have thought of it later. Since the response was submitted, the code should include the correct path. The transcript mentions ""7 times... 4... 4... 7"" but not clearly the steps. The code needs to represent the operations leading to the correct answer, even if the transcript doesn't detail each step. The participant might have backtracked or tried different operations before finding the correct one.
