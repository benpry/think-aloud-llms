18," Okay, so I messed up on the other one. I actually got the answer in my head and was working it out, but ran out of time. So, let's see here. I need to get to 4. If I want to do 8 times 3, I would have to get those numbers 13, 5, and 6 somehow equal 3. And I don't think I can do that, so let's explore other options. 13 minus 5 is 8, so 8 plus 8 is 16, and then plus 6 would be 22, and I'd be missing 2. So, 13 minus 6 is 7. No, that wouldn't work out. It needs to be divisible by... 4 and 8. So, um, let's see. 8 times 6 is 48, and that would leave me with 13 and 15, which I can't really do much with. So, um... What's 13 times 5? Let me see. 65. And 8 times 6 is 48. That would not work. 5 plus 8 is 13. 13 plus 13 is 26. Gosh, I feel like every time there's a 5, it throws things off. Um...

29," All right, next one. It's big numbers again. This will be harder. Okay, so, let's see, 12 minus 7 is 5. That doesn't work there. Let's see. Nope. Any division is going to be wrong because it's got multiple. Let's see if I can do some multiplication here. Let's see what we come up with. 6 and then 2, 3, carry the 1, 6, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20. 5. Then, divide by that, which would be, nope, that doesn't work. Shoot. Let's try those two together. Let's see here. 1, 2, 1, carry the 4. Okay. Let's see there. Oh, 7 and 5. We come up with a decimal, so that doesn't work. And I take care of there. That comes up with 29. That's not right. I'm not going to be able to get this one. So, I'll sit here and continue to talk about the numbers to try to help you in your experiment, but this one's beyond me. I don't know how to do it. So, anything I've tried, I've tried multiplication. I've tried division. I've tried grouping them to do both things, and I come up with close answers. I've come up with 29. I've come up with 28. I came up with 26 one time, but I cannot hit the 24 number. So, like I say, I'm trying to continue to talk to you so that it matches up with what you want in your experiment. But I've tried the things that I can see to try on this one, and this one's too hard for me. So, I'll just continue to sit here with you until I time out. So, hopefully the three minutes runs out pretty quick because this is getting frustrating. All right. Still waiting for that three minutes to run out.
